53,itsclarityco,youtube,Really ?? I have no idea who they are.
28,thebackstagebunch,tiktok,wait how about see the couple making out but they are not couple??
51,itsclarityco,youtube,"The part where you mentioned “Your parents didn’t leave you when you were young. So you don’t leave them when they’re old” can we reflect back to that statement. What if they MENTALLY left us? Sure they were just there “Physically” but what if they left mentally. As kids, we love it when parents showered us with encouragement and support. So even if they’re just physically in presence but never there mentally, how would you explain that?"
82,welloshow,youtube,Love we’ll always watched at Tiktok . Today so happy to watch at YouTube . Love y’all

65,thebackstagebunch,youtube,Mashallah 2.28 
84,welloshow,youtube,"this topic i feel treads on dangerous grounds which thankfully managed to steer away from becoming a toxic debate. too many perspectives and approaches, boys and girls approach this differently, character also plays a part. introverts and extroverts and generation also plays a part. 

22:16-23:00... the risk is being led on to the point of no return where you end up having your emotions crumpled and you being a like a carpet stepped all over.

nice guys finish last."
