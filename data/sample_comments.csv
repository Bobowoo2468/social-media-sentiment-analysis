45,itsclarityco,youtube,"It's a moral responsibility of a child to take care of there parents when they are unable to do so
And if it is a question for you to take care of your parents or not
Then you don't deserve your parents"
13,itsclarityco,tiktok,"any woman below 30 who is wealthy out there, im up to be a stay at home husband thanks."
58,itsclarityco,youtube,"Filial piety, to me, is different at different stages of my life. When I'm still a school-going kid/teen, filial piety is respecting them, honouring them, and being obedient or at least respectfully explaining my views to them if our opinions differ. As I grow up and start working and earning my keep, on top of all those mentioned previously, need to give them monthly allowance while still providing for myself and my family if I'm married. But as they grow older and become more sickly and need closer care and supervision, then filial piety to me is putting them before myself. Sacrificing my own needs to ensure that all their living and healthcare needs are met."

56,itsclarityco,youtube,"watching this podcast reminds me of myself when i was a child. I also had an ambitious mom who worked the entire day and people were always saying things (as the host hazelle has done here too) like it's ""needed"" for moms to send the kid to infant care (or in my case, left in the hands of FDWs). My sibling and I grew up to be neglected kids who have issues with intimacy, and I don't want my future kids to go through the same thing. The truth is that it's not necessarily ""needed"" to sacrifice time with the kid! You always have a choice - sometimes it means having to give up a job or interest if you prioritise the child. On a systemic level, I think Sg is also not the most family-friendly place to work in this respect."
9,itsclarityco,tiktok,i think that raising kids the right way with love and passion it won't even be a matter of discussion it'll just happen not bcuz y owe them or anything but bcuz you love them unconditionally

50,itsclarityco,youtube,thank you for sharing your personal experience with us! There's definitely no right or wrong way to parent (and no manual given!). What's most important is for us to find the right balance for your own family. 
23,thebackstagebunch,tiktok,why need official? 18 year old no financial or emotional stability official for what?
46,itsclarityco,youtube,"Point to note here is that Maintenance of Parents act is only used at the most extreme of situations. That‚Äôs why you hardly ever hear it being used and the when it is used, the verdict is such that children don‚Äôt give obscene amounts. Like filial piety, the law is laid out there, but then there are a bunch of folks that like to misuse these concepts and hit their children hard. Eg. If you don‚Äôt give me $x you are unfilial,I can sue you. But if it‚Äôs a gambler parent, this law does not applies. And Confucius does explain that in such a situation you don‚Äôt have to feed your parents demands (ÊÑöÂ≠ù), instead the filial way to correct them. But Confucius has one requirement for this, he says correct them respectfully."

57,itsclarityco,youtube,"Singapore‚Äôs high rank structures are based solely on educational levels. Not Combat experience and exposures.
