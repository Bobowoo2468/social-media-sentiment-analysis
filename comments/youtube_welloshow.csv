39,"Gifting hair to someone is actually a symbol of devotion can also be considered a sign of love. Especially before two lovers part ways. E.g going to war where they will part for long and there's no confirmation that the guy will come back alive. 

So yeah. That's explain the hair gift. Prolly the girl is devoting her undying love to them "

14,the way haikal look n smile at the girl in black...
15,"okay time to change my tinder profile bio... also, the man in orange sweater is very cute"
16,"i feel the past few episodes are more like interview rather than podcast, you guys go straight into the written down points which is quite unentertaining as compared to more relaxed or a lengthy intro"
17,Can we get a Q.A question during the podcast
18,aslem so quiet like he not there
19,Aslem introvert 
20,53:30 ni men signal apa ni

28,Shanise so beautiful sia
29,Who is the main guy?
30,i dm every girl I know and I always seen them as friends
31,Who is josephine doh?
32,"this topic i feel treads on dangerous grounds which thankfully managed to steer away from becoming a toxic debate. too many perspectives and approaches, boys and girls approach this differently, character also plays a part. introverts and extroverts and generation also plays a part. 

22:16-23:00... the risk is being led on to the point of no return where you end up having your emotions crumpled and you being a like a carpet stepped all over.

nice guys finish last."
33,Where pippo?
34,noce
35,i feel like the girl in white dun let the girl in black talk
36,I think I know who Shanise dated at the last part

39,nice episode. invite nice2 girls
40,i need Haikal to dm me on how he styles his hair sial
41,"Honestly this episode is a bit boring. The intro is too quick, like it‚Äôd be better if you can intro who is Shanise (altho most of us know her) & Josephine. Josephine is abit too introverted for a podcast."
42,any of these girls looking for fwb?? i am so down
0,Man it's been awhile since there was a long video and I'm loving this
1,"wah this episode really made me relate a lot and also made me reflect on how i live life. sham‚Äôs advice or just opening up about his life and how he became who he is, was really inspirational. looked up to him before on tiktok but never knew his backstory. will move forward with his advices in mind! :D"
2,"Love this episode , feeling inspired just from listening to what Shah has to say. Keep up the good work Wello."
3,Sham is a great conversationalist but the interviewers should stop interrupting him. It‚Äôs painful to watch. It‚Äôs okay to be curious but learn to pause and ask questions at the right time.
4,Great conversation! Respect 
5,never felt a 1 hour plus video not bored cause of how sham talks and his motivation
6,Fuh  3.58am in malaysia rn. Aku patut ya tidur but terlayan podcast bai. Srsly nice work love your story sham. Love from malaysia

11,Best episode yet
12,This is my new favourite episode

0,I feel Juff has a very likeable personality. Nice person vibes. All the best for the fight bro
1,its rlly surprising how similar sham and juff are‚Ä¶rlly proud of them both for overcoming what they went through‚Ä¶its true what they say that most of the time ur enemy are the ones that are the most similar to you‚Ä¶all the best to them both for the fight and may the better boxer win 
2,"the last segment was really like a big hug man :) thankyou mat for sharing your experience, really glad i spent 2 hours watching this episode "
3,"I'm looking forward for both Jufri & Sham to berdamai... whilst the world is coming to an end stop fighting guys...

& jujur dari tutur kata both of u in this interview both of u still have care & love of each other. U both may not know that ada yg sengaja nak laga¬≤ kan both of u...

like wat Juff said both of u have bizz to hustle with.. both of u somehow have gd in u & I'm sure as a public figure u both wanna continue reach out to pplp in an inspiring ways..

remove the toxic remove the ego maju sama¬≤ support & show love to the world & for each other... this is my take..

Fighting solves nothing...
& after boxing in the professional ring wats the aftermath n satisfaction seeing each other injured? in pain? bleed? 

wat if k.o? Nauzubillah... 
Thus far all professional Athletes will still feel sad or be in tears when they see their opponents lie flat unconscious..

Sabr, Sabr, Sabr... itulah panji perikemanusiaan... 


again both of u are good guys... 
jgn terjebak dgn desakkan bisikkan Syaitan..

I'm nobody nor am I perfect nor a fighter I'm nothing but I easily feel sad seeing our own pplp having beef, fighting, bickering on each other. it's all about 'words of choice' 

Akhir kata I wish both all well dan saya doa semoga u both come to terms & berdamai.. Insyaallah.. Aamin.."
4,i think both of them (juffri and sham) kene datang balik dekat wello after the fight. just an opinion
5,Very good episode. Jufri speaking facts abt depression.hes a nice guy. Awesome host. Aku terlampau suke ni episode sia. HAHAHA
6,"He gotta do more songs bro, he got a good voice"
7,The anxiety part is seriously on point. Only those who go through it will know
8,"been supportng wello since 2019 bro , best duo"
9,"The last part is nice. My depression is the suffer in silence kind. And when it hits hard, I don't have anyone who reaches out and no one to reach out to.. Its just a vicious cycle."
10,Let‚Äôs go! #teamjuffri!
11,good episode!
12,Wish there were English subtitles :‚Äô(
13,Yala this was 2 days ago which is Sunday.. they speak Malay on Sunday rite?
14,Finally it‚Äôs both sides!
15,"Yup, I also have lavender oil when I have anxiety.."
16,Its true tho the fan base for sham rahman r kids n i feel tt jufri orangnye real
17,English subtitles would be perfect
18,Great vid but do try to speak more in English 
19,apa description pmpn tu 
20,"As a Malaysian listener can i know what a matrep is

23,aku dengar dua dua berbual its lowkey orang around them yang provoke abe they misunderstood each other abe end up gaduh because of the barber
24,I was waiting for him to converse in English but he didn't
25,"Love the interview with sham, was anticipating to watch this too. However i can't understand malay :("
26,"bro my heart felt words, you guys needs speak more english to cater to the general public man."
27,Can consider subtitles for the malay speaking part my Gs
28,juff is so humble and down to earth unlike sham lol
29,Because cd and police many malay. So they call Abang2. Army many chinese. They only call Abg to the transport operator. Abang2 drebar. Hihi
30,I dk malay bro
31,Needs some English subs
32,Pompan tu kenape? Kulit gelap?
33,"mengarut sia juffri ni. kejap kata sham buat content sebijik sama dia, sekejap kata shah Iskandar cakap content sama, sekejap kata tak kisah sama tapi kata video template sebijik dia. Lepastu buat buat tanya Barber mana satu. Petik semua nama nak cakap org side dia. hahahahha"
34,abang abang askar?
35,You can see who is the bigger person in this mess
