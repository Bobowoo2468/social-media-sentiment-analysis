0,indirectly saying jade rasif sia lolol
1,arguing abt money? titus not rich meh?
2,titus is a cb kia... period hahahaha
3,glad that cheryl realises how important it is to find a good guy. i hope that you can find someone better if not being by yourself is totally fine
4,they arguing about money? titus no money meh?
5,titus got no money
6,"so how, you miss titus"
7,but everyone knew titus swings the other way
8,argue with titus becos everytime he speak she cant understand
9,how does titus argue with you when the words that come out from his mouth don't even make sense?
10,she wants to 'educate' about love but she ownself say she love titus bcs he knows how to play the piano......
11,i thought titus is gay
12,this made me change my opinion about her. i mean i don't really know her but just the fact that she was with titus made me judge her but she shows here that she is pretty mature
13,titus no money meh?
14,there's a reason why she decided have children like within 1 yr of marriage. thinking that would lock down titus and his wealth. hope it worth the chi
15,titus left because he doesn't want to choose the child
16,who is titus?
17,"titus kukubird itchy, thats about it la"
18,ironically how she spend so much time now explaining than spend it before getting married with titus
19,i didn't know titus was poor
20,i think titus have a sugar daddy/ rich bf to spend on him previously and now he have to earn and save for himself and family.
21,she's sounds too eloquent to be with titus anyways hahh
22,i hope cheryl finds a better person to be with for her and her kid
23,who are these people
24,nowdays really is any1 with microphone can open podcast n gong jiaowei
25,that's why don't choose so fast
26,thank you for teaching us common sense
27,"you can fall in love easily. but once u create a new life, please spare more thoughts on the new life, don't ruin his/her life....."
28,but if its about money money shldnt she grow up thinking i want to study and work hard so i dont suffer
29,that was such a good wake up call
30,wisdom speaks
31,100% agree what u say... give a good environment instead of staying in a toxic marriage
32,"people about unconditional love from others, but can they do the same too.."
33,jiaowei girl
34,"is that guy acoustic, what was that..."
35,sure...sure....that all too need money
36,sohai lo choose him

46,true
47,"ai yi ge ren ke yi bu yong qian , dan zheng ming ai xu yao ."
48,wish i could share this on instagram story
49,i like the fact she balanced it with the same statement about the wife ... tables have turned in many household these days
50,i thought they said they still love each other and the divorce is mutual? now the true story is out
51,aiyoo if all chabo like this .....
52,is this the guy from culture sg ? saw him outside of hard rock interviewing people
53,aww i feel she is an amazing and beautiful mom
54,the words i told my mom when i ask her to leave my dad
55,i choose you to be my mum
56,lol i thought is amicable breakup? then how come got this feedback now
57,money ?
58,"ppl don't process the fact that she said ""if""... it's just an example or a neutral statement.."
59,this
60,"i told my fren when i didn't like his gf, ""remember, not only u choose a wife, but u choose a mother for ur children.."""
61,boom!
62,go for brad goh
63,strong independent woman
64,better or worse ... all rs have issues .. they looked like a nice couple
65,maderr.
66,"woah woah slow down

67,so thts why they split?
68,indeed a very very wise choice to leave him . you are so much stronger than him
69,believe it but never go there

74,@withlovezura
75,@rajiniswari shalini @darsh
76,yes you can choose your husband but the guy can also choose who he wants as his wife in the end of the day
77,so why did they divorce?
78,more singaporean girls need to hear that. fight fight fight
79,"send this to my dad's fyp lol. go and remarry, didn't consider that while he got a new wife he is also getting us a ""new mom"" which we don't need"
80,sibei lanjiao wei. dont itchy can liao lah you choose on behalf
81,unconditional love doesnt exist...
82,through that both is not suitable
83,to me this is child abuse really pity those kids who need to grow up with separated parents
84,where is the tv remote? i tot they using @prismplus tv that can hey google?
85,"that statement was suppose 2b ponder b4 marriage n not after~otherwise divorce is pending. love is d willingness to give n not d greed 2 take,more n more each subsequent times"
86,"thats why i'm extremely glad after 2 years, still no children blessing in disguise"
87,kmn talk cock la marketing strategy
88,when women love men unconditionally?.. when?
89,"choose a husband who isn't bisexual as well, it helps loads ."
90,sg so materialistic just choose who has the most money even if they are abusive and irresponsible
91,find a guy that is not gay
92,sad such wisdom didnt occur to her earlier
93,"rafah is being bombarded as we speak. pure evil. it is sickening. search where is rafah #superbowlmassacre
#rafahmassacre"
94,well said.
95,that's why you don't open your leg so fast until you know the person better and think you won't argue with them over petty things.
96,u so ahglee
97,i sense argumentative vibes from her ..
98,its normal for you to make mistakes when you are young. learn from it. move on and correct yourself along the way. haters gonna hate but both of them deserves a pat on their back for acknowledging it
99,who?
100,kids these days
101,yap so much. the whole world knew it was a bad idea to get married after meeting for 3 weeks. only you dk
102,then why you let him shotgun irresponsibly
103,"talk so much like love guru, in the end also divorce. like that give advice can meh?"
104,i really don't understand why u only realise this after the fact lmao. called it a mile away you 2 would eventually split and ur child is now a stat
105,"in first place.. how we know they really marriage in real..
lesson learned..
both hv diff thinking..
one can't speak properly ..one is well spoken ..
everyone hv diff thinking of values n money!"
106,think of the consequences before getting in bed with anyone.
107,"even though kids cant choose who their parents are,in the 1st place,the parents cant choose whether they going to have kids or not,no matter what u try,that is god's choice"
108,we're suppose to take parenting advice frm a woman who got married after 3 weeks of marriage n got pregnant soon after then divorced?
109,interviewing someone who don't even know whats the real meaning of love
110,now your daughter has the mentally that when she grow up she can just married any guy that she love at the first sight and got married within 24 hours
111,"if you si smart , then why you chose a husband that argue everyday"
112,if she said it like that then her daughter will likely grow up marrying ah beng ah seng like the father style
113,it took you a baby to realise he is an overgrown immature man child?
114,"divorce already sudden going around showing how it was worse for her, then go podcast teach life lessons. really a gem of a person."
115,yu ken cus yo hasbwen bat yo cildren kennot cus dey fah-de
116,be realistic know yourself first and what you can tolerate and expect. don't suffer your kid to be born for the wrong reason- that is not very responsible!
117,"i rmb u try twitching then failed, then find him for retirement but failed"
118,"the hormonal changes when a woman becomes a mother, sense of responsibility"
119,hope ur daughter learns to not anyhow sleep around too
120,but u blindly chose him
121,can't take a pumped and dumped girl seriously
122,unconditional love? get a dog
123,and where did your daughter got that idea?
124,adelle singaporean version
125,u can choose not to have kid. the world has enough population. you are bringing another human to this toxic world.
126,she made bad choices and can now advise others? wtf
127,"there is no such thing as unconditional love, as everything in life comes with a condition."
128,like that that pup pup pup leow ah?
129,"""u can choose your husband"", then she proceeds to choose a man who sells his nude? wow"
130,rip la this rs
131,now suddenly become life coach lol
132,blah blah blah 1 sided story
133,ironic statement coming out from a person who married the other party within months of knowing each other haha
134,she said a whole bunch of nothing
135,doesn't want to give but take take take and she admitted to it. modern feminism will be the end of the world
136,"u can choose to be responsible n nt get pregnant, nw ur kid suffers frm 2 individual parents making ur logic redundant."
137,"the first thing you discuss about a man is money, rather than man that loves you, treasure you, value you and respect you. prioritises ah"
138,she's be more pretty if she smiles only
139,she has a handsome face
140,"child is part of e prnts flsh&bld,thrs only so much nurture can do,is basically nurture v nature at e end of e day apple wont fall far from the tree"
141,tulah baru kenal brapa hari terus kahwin dah hmmmmmmmmmm
142,she jus explained common sense
143,lol... soooo why sia.. haiz
144,why they never though of this before shooting inside. then now their kids suffer more in a broken family.
145,set an example for your poor kid ...... dun lighting divorce .....
146,she went money in the first place now talk like some saint
147,the mother already set example no?
148,lol you influences all the same
149,them getting together was a publicity stunt. y'all falling for it is exactly what they wanted
150,never knew mother and father were spelled with d
151,one big round... back to no money no honey
152,these freaking influencers..what are they influencing really?
153,chose the wrong guy... red flag from the very start
154,than cook and clean and learn to not dress for the stress than you will find love
155,why does a divorcee opinion matter when she obviously made lots of bad choices in such a short span of her relationship. might as well ask a gambler for investing advice.
156,one month earn 3 k. but super love u. and eveyrhjng about u. will u consider
157,talking about urself huh
158,don't marry no such problem
159,hmmm....don't have kids lor... problem solved.
160,be a diao kia loh
161,then u want your child to think your vow and promises in sickness and in health is all fake? mama and papa married just for fun ?
162,"lol nothing to talk about , so now talk about this lol"
163,so basically what she saying is that she married for money.
164,short gun married
165,are those white hair or accessories?
166,but it's sad if the child is being taken care of by other ppl while the father goes for my holidays and bragging about it online
167,in a divorce the child is always the biggest loser
168,yapper
169,fader mader
170,go and find ang mo big dik la
,0
0,lj la say boyfriend 2 word very hard meh
1,wait till you play the uno reverse card. watch the reaction
2,yaya talk to so much but if the guy do this confirm fight break up not happy
3,"if they don't introduce the person as gf/bf, prolly they don't plan on sticking around for that long :')"
4,she wants to keep her options open...
5,gaslighting at its finest man!
6,that's it?! who am i to u?!!
7,"i think when introducing someone important to you, it should be done properly. to be fair and show that he is important to me in my life."
8,if it's the other way round . 101% sure prata alrdy
9,part 2 outnow
10,they beyond to the street brooo
11,obviously they ain't done partying
12,"hold hands, kissing and making out dont necessarily make u the couple, u might think it but to her u might be friday, or food bringer, or chauffeur"
13,confirm want to cheat one
14,what u mean it's too real? what the hell are they talking about? they are essentially justifying lies
15,aiya they say anything also can la guys say anything then different story
16,yo then dont get married
17,"this is my husband, my bestfriend, my fiance, my half, my everything @jin islam"
18,welcome to the next episode of fact or
19,her option to turn back and say i never was in a relationship #plastic
20,commitment problem den say lah
21,"i got u, i dont even mention girlfriend or wife"
22,"no it's not enough it can be viewed as fwb as well people now a days too judge mental so u have to say this is my girlf, this is my boyf"
23,"bf got labeled as a ""person"" and she asked ""why do u need to be labeled"""
24,keeping their options open.
25,"if it's hard to introduce your other half, he or she isn't the one."
26,"if u called by name, but end up kissing, people around u will be asking, so u guys are partners?so what is so difficult about just say this my bf? lol"
27,these are confused wannabe ang mo culture. even ang mo says...this is my hubby.
28,is a red flag... the reason why u should say he your bf so the other will get the back out of it... also is a respect for him
29,so whiny
30,tell me you have underlying issues without telling me..
31,cuzz you've been comfortable alone for awhile...that is why. possibly just dating men after men but nothing worked out long term
32,it's another story if it's your parents
33,merepek
34,"relationship is not a force, once you fall in love with someone, it will grow blossom till you didn't realised you're happy to say your loveones"
35,i just feel our ability to communicate and be vulnerable with others is decreasing
36,if you don't say that your husband or bf they will thought you are single
37,when you need controversial statements to boost your ratings..
38,that's it??? that's all i am to you??.....
39,"ladies plsss.. who are you kidding. you both will be the first to kick a big fuss & mad when your man say, she is so and so ""name"""
40,it's fine... as long as the guys don't address the girl as girlfriend.
41,"now only say like this when get married, confirm plus chop different story"
42,commitment issue
43,not wanting to own their decisions
44,plis watch part 2 guys. such a double standard
45,they wanna be different so bad.
46,"i usually say ""that's my wife"" while pointing at a box of tissues."
47,means commitment issues lah
48,#commitmentissues
49,eh this girl if thor is her boyfriend she'll def say it's her bf
50,"life is too short girl, in 50 yrs times, you will say that is my husband."
51,munaaaahhhhh !!!! u tell em !!!!!!!!!!!
52,this iss soooooo truueeeeeee
53,why do i feel cringe and secondhand embarrassment simple thing made complicated
54,"munah, that could be a situation-ship also so need the correct label"
55,"actually that's pretty true, so at least after the break up, they will regard him as ""his name"" instead of whoever's boyfriend."
56,eh uncle raymond siiioooooooot
57,fazz is simping
58,i would say its my client
59,i cant agree with the husband part.. but boyfriend still okay to call as partner.
60,if ang moh then everyday you will hear the word husband 1000 times wherever they go.
61,id intro my bf or husband... cuz im happy to have bf or husband ...
62,if i i will be proud to mention if thats my husband
63,munah has a point
64,sounds like peeps have commitment issues
65,bruh if the tables were turned......
66,so she got more choices
67,"the other way round, if we don't ""label"" them, it becomes a united nations emergency issue!"
68,ape saje je ni pompan
69,i'd love to call someone my wife idk what's the issue with these girls hahahaha idw labels idw this then don't have bf la
70,no topic
71,its hard for them to call the guy their boyfriends because they have more then one guy . they just taking care of the guys heart lol
72,this is why we need tate...
73,call him to to
74,chill lah..the feeling is mutual
75,"""hey this is faz and i have commitment issues"""
76,no wonder hashy and marc divorce
77,probably don't wanna lose them attraction eh
78,tooootally agree with munah
79,"say what u wanna say, in the end, confirm do opposite. especially if its reverse situation."
80,"""this my baby daddyyyy "" as i point to my husband"

82,i am so proud of my husbandd! i was so happy to introduce him to everyone
83,this 2 not real ...long term making guys suffer
84,ps of him just say la for the money only right

86,wives don't say husband. they say daddy.
87,and this people are putting their opinions on the next generation they themselves need help
88,hmm fair enough ig

90,"probably the guy would say the same after marriage ""this is my partner"""
91,"tts y, till now they're not married. lol."

99,i like the word spouse!!!!! yall know i love married life pls. im going to have 10 kids
100,and thats how he got a second wife. (the first was just called a person)

103,airheads
104,if really love will say one
105,do what you want! just don't double standard.
106,just ask his husband to try say like that to.
107,wait how about see the couple making out but they are not couple??
108,munah is getting hotter and hotter
109,"if its not important, then why even get married"
110,"get me on this show, y'all! please."
111,"if a guy did that, the girl would say that the guy want to hit on other girls"
112,"and sometimes u assume they are a couple, they be like ""who are u to assume"""
113,"yes, i agreed with you laid"
114,"that ""person"" holding hands and making out with munah on the couch could prob be a scandal ahh since no need intro as boyf what"
