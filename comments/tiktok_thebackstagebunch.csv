1,Arguing abt money? Titus not rich meh?
2,Glad that Cheryl realises how important it is to find a good guy. I hope that you can find someone better 🥰 if not being by yourself is totally fine
3,they arguing about money? Titus no money meh?
4,argue with titus becos everytime he speak she cant understand 😂
5,Titus got no money
6,Titus is a CB Kia… period hahahaha
7,"So how, you miss Titus"
8,I thought Titus is gay
9,Titus no money meh?
10,But everyone knew Titus swings the other way
11,She wants to ‘educate’ about love but she ownself say she love titus bcs he knows how to play the piano……
12,How does Titus argue with you when the words that come out from his mouth don't even make sense?
13,Titus left because he doesn't want to choose the child
14,"Titus kukubird itchy, thats about it la😁"
15,This made me change my opinion about her. I mean I don’t really know her but just the fact that she was with Titus made me judge her but she shows here that she is pretty mature
16,there's a reason why she decided have children like within 1 yr of marriage. thinking that would lock down Titus and his wealth. hope it worth the chi
17,I hope cheryl finds a better person to be with for her and her kid 💘
18,who is Titus?
19,she's sounds too eloquent to be with Titus anyways HAHh
20,I think Titus have a sugar daddy/ rich bf to spend on him previously and now he have to earn and save for himself and family.
21,That’s why don’t choose so fast 🤣
22,who are these people😳
23,Ironically how she spend so much time now explaining than spend it before getting married with Titus🙃
24,I didn’t know Titus was poor
25,Thank you for teaching us common sense

49,Ppl don’t process the fact that she said “if”… it’s just an example or a neutral statement..
50,I thought they said they still love each other and the divorce is mutual? Now the true story is out
51,"Is that guy acoustic, what was that…"
52,better or worse … all rs have issues .. they looked like a nice couple
53,"I told my Fren when I didn't like his gf, ""remember, not only u choose a wife, but u choose a mother for ur children.."""
