99,rach l True
100,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia 
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
109,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
110,longer episodes like this are what we need
111,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe "
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
116,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
117,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
118,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
119,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
120,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
121,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
124,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
125,Appreciate the long episode!!!
126,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes! 
127,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3
128,Now this is an awesome show..
129,YAS jade and saffron! and dew!! 
130,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
131,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
132,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
133,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
134,Love the long episode! This feels right
135,Love the group dynamics
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
137,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
138,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated "
139,"Great to see Saff backkk!
  Aquarius queens Jade and Saff"
140,Yes The OG's are back
141,GO KEISHA!!! I love you!!
142,I love how each of you all get to talk

144,Enjoyed this. And COMPLETELY agreed with the girls when they were schooling Dew
145,Definitely better than the current real talk
146,your lighting setup was really dope bro!
147,"The moment i see their faces on the couch, subscribed."
148,"I just want to be best friends with Dew and Saff man, loving the chemistry"
149,CAN'T WAIT FORTHE NEXT EP!!!
150,Im kinda curious how jade’s child is doing and how he/she looks like hehe

100,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia 
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
109,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
110,longer episodes like this are what we need
111,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe "
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
116,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
117,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
118,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
119,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
120,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
121,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
124,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
125,Appreciate the long episode!!!
126,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes! 
127,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3

130,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
131,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
132,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
133,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
134,Love the long episode! This feels right
135,Love the group dynamics
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
137,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
138,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated "
139,"Great to see Saff backkk!

100,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia 
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
109,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
110,longer episodes like this are what we need
111,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe "
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
116,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
117,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
118,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
119,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
120,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
121,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
124,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
125,Appreciate the long episode!!!
126,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes! 
127,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3
128,Now this is an awesome show..
129,YAS jade and saffron! and dew!! 
130,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
131,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
132,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
133,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
134,Love the long episode! This feels right
135,Love the group dynamics
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
137,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
138,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated "
139,"Great to see Saff backkk!

147,"The moment i see their faces on the couch, subscribed."

410,Cheating is honestly the worst thing you could ever do in a marriage. Whats the point in getting married if youll end up cheating ? Just dont get committed.
411,"Cheating is a choice made, it is not inevitable. If you can’t even control yourself and have the discipline and morale to stay loyal and committed to your partner, then I feel like you shouldn’t get into any relationship, unless it’s mutually open. (Just my opinion)."
412,How can u admit to cheating with a straight face lol
413,If dew says all his past gf's were insecure.... then has he considered the fact that maybe he was the problem to begin with?
414,"Of course attractive people would say cheating is not so bad or even okay. The world is their oyster and they can always find someone better out there. The rest of us who are less attractive don't have the opportunity if we wanted to, how to cheat? haha."
415,Tbh they talking about how if you feel you don’t love someone anymore then just leave but like love can be a choice to go through the good and bad with someone so i really couldnt relate on this LEL sorry man
416,The captions is so on point like literally
417,dew must do an episode about amelia though
418,"""idk la what they talking"""
419,"I’m not ok with the boyfriend telling all his problems, especially problems in our relationship to another female friend... anyone with me?"
420,Munah's neck not tired ah? Keep tilting
421,Omo. The way dew touched his heart when talking about Amelia ♡
422,basically dun commit until the trust is there if not its just toxic af
423,"Wanna hear more about you guys’ views on polygamy AND polyamory; where to draw the line, what is and isn’t ok etc 
Keep the episodes coming love em!"
424,"Damn tbh if you're really young, you should realise feelings  are complicated and that feelings for another person come and go. Those feelings can come when you're in a relationship or when you're single, so it makes things especially complicated. Give it a few weeks and those feelings for the new person might just leave completely anyway. Munah talk talk only, wouldn't go so far as emotional cheating ala ""I really love this new guy"". If the guy interesting then can make friend what"
425,they are literally JUST SAYING anything they want. love the chaotic energy
426,"Be it any relationship, communication plays an important role in avoiding any unnecessary drama/problem."
427,"OMG i was waiting for a new ep for so longggggggggggggg
FINALLY"
428,"Finally a new episode, would be nice if y’al talk one at a time though, its quite chaotic with everyone talking haha, just saying ;)"
429,Just found this channel and I love y'all!
430,Truths or not aside. Salute to all of you for the confession to the world.
431,"""babe whr r u""

432,living for the chaotic energy lmao
433,this cast is perfection
434,"Love Munah’s free passes

436,The pillow matching safff
437,"I have one question"" when a guy who is going thru NS and the girl cheated him what is inside the girls mindset of them being so impatient that they can't wait for them too book out?"""
438,Aww jade is wearing Saffron’s holoq shirt

446,MORE!!
447,So this is where the real talk left to... I don’t find the new cast lives up to the old cast...good to see I can get the real talk cast and format back
448,done watching! enjoyed it!
449,Matching pillow and blouse set
450,I like this video before i watch it 
451,Dew And Saffy looking good as usual
452,Munah I'm disappointed you don't want dumbledore
453,This is total chaos sia hahahaha
454,I wanna hear an episode about prenuptial agreements
455,Munah is either touching her knee/leg or her hair? Constantly
456,Definitely better than Real Talk cheating episode...hahah but love both<3
457,Don’t cheat in a relationship.  You don’t gain anything but you lose more.
458,Nice Air Jordan 1 High OG!
459,its good to have Dew. saying the male pov HAHA
460,if u notice munah always look like she got stiff neck cos she trying not to move her hair (?) lol
461,How about a topic on STD?
462,"Shoot out to all of cast from Indonesia,damn what an enjoyable arguments from all of you"
463,Tea spilled 
464,That ‘Shook pikachu’ caption 
465,Good one.
466,Let's go with Saffron's topic of polygamy/non-monogamous
467,But I like how Dew is the only realist in this discussion.
468,"lmaooooo the subbed ""boombayah"" after they all said ya @ 16:09"
469,"Cheating in a relationship is unhealthy.. If you do not want to be in a relationship with that person anymore, just break up so both parties can move on. Instead of trying to still be with that person and fulfill your own thirst for other guys/girls. That is so selfish. Marriage in the other hand is totally different from just a regular relationship, marriage is a commitment and a responsibility both have to bear. If you have desires to cheat and also cannot forego the lifestyle, don't bother to try marrying or getting married."
470,I trust my gut cause they are always right when i catch the imposters while playing among us
471,Remove censoring plsss. I want to hear all the cibais and lanchiaoossss XD
472,3:11 Dew korek hidong..k bye
473,Honestly I feel the take a video of the entire room came about cause they experienced too many cheaters in their relationship so you cant really fault them for trying to be uk assured
474,Unfortunately this is why most men have trust issues nowadays. Fun episode though
475,Whats the bg song ya at the start?? Anyone??
476,Yes. Polygamy topic pls! Hahaha or open relationship!

488,HHaha the arguing is funny as
489,Jade’s the best
490,15:08 Kesian the subtitles guy 
491,to me i think cheating is doing what couples do. hold hands kissing hugging fking. all these is cheating. go out with another girl but nvr do all this is totally fine.. friend only mah
492,keisha is really really beautiful 
493,cheating is cheating no label no excuse just dont commit to a relationship is not for everyone 
494,"what about dumbledore, munah?"
495,"11:10 The highest I call someone was from night 11 PM to 5 AM, it was about 689 missed calls back in 2008

PS: Am Not crazy. I was 17. I just wanted to clear a misunderstanding with my girlfriend, which we did when she woke up, received the call, called me crazy and I slept like a baby till noon."

101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia 
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
109,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
110,longer episodes like this are what we need
111,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe "
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
116,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
117,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
118,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
119,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
120,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
121,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
124,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
125,Appreciate the long episode!!!
126,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes! 
127,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3

130,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
131,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
132,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
133,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
134,Love the long episode! This feels right
135,Love the group dynamics
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
137,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
138,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated "
139,"Great to see Saff backkk!

147,"The moment i see their faces on the couch, subscribed."

380,"Keisha and Munah...in la senza, I've watched them 3 times and have learnt nothing. But will still continue watching them. #simp"
381,"Munah and Kesha look like sales rep to me, while Jade is from R&D department and Dew is the columnist"
382,3:23 ada props!hahaha so cute lah munah!

407,"so, jade single?"
408,hhahahahah
409,sheesh
410,Cheating is honestly the worst thing you could ever do in a marriage. Whats the point in getting married if youll end up cheating ? Just dont get committed.
411,"Cheating is a choice made, it is not inevitable. If you can’t even control yourself and have the discipline and morale to stay loyal and committed to your partner, then I feel like you shouldn’t get into any relationship, unless it’s mutually open. (Just my opinion)."
412,How can u admit to cheating with a straight face lol
413,If dew says all his past gf's were insecure.... then has he considered the fact that maybe he was the problem to begin with?
414,"Of course attractive people would say cheating is not so bad or even okay. The world is their oyster and they can always find someone better out there. The rest of us who are less attractive don't have the opportunity if we wanted to, how to cheat? haha."
415,Tbh they talking about how if you feel you don’t love someone anymore then just leave but like love can be a choice to go through the good and bad with someone so i really couldnt relate on this LEL sorry man
416,The captions is so on point like literally
417,dew must do an episode about amelia though
418,"""idk la what they talking"""
419,"I’m not ok with the boyfriend telling all his problems, especially problems in our relationship to another female friend... anyone with me?"
420,Munah's neck not tired ah? Keep tilting
421,Omo. The way dew touched his heart when talking about Amelia ♡
422,basically dun commit until the trust is there if not its just toxic af
423,"Wanna hear more about you guys’ views on polygamy AND polyamory; where to draw the line, what is and isn’t ok etc 
Keep the episodes coming love em!"
424,"Damn tbh if you're really young, you should realise feelings  are complicated and that feelings for another person come and go. Those feelings can come when you're in a relationship or when you're single, so it makes things especially complicated. Give it a few weeks and those feelings for the new person might just leave completely anyway. Munah talk talk only, wouldn't go so far as emotional cheating ala ""I really love this new guy"". If the guy interesting then can make friend what"
425,they are literally JUST SAYING anything they want. love the chaotic energy
426,"Be it any relationship, communication plays an important role in avoiding any unnecessary drama/problem."
427,"OMG i was waiting for a new ep for so longggggggggggggg
FINALLY"
428,"Finally a new episode, would be nice if y’al talk one at a time though, its quite chaotic with everyone talking haha, just saying ;)"
429,Just found this channel and I love y'all!
430,Truths or not aside. Salute to all of you for the confession to the world.
431,"""babe whr r u""
""home""
""take a photo beside ur fish tank holding a spoon in right hand and make a 3 sign with your left hand""
-
this kind cannot prepare beforehand :p"
432,living for the chaotic energy lmao
433,this cast is perfection
434,"Love Munah’s free passes 
 gonna use that next time"
435,"Since y'all mention abit about weird Munah's weird kinks, why not an episode about that one day?"
436,The pillow matching safff
437,"I have one question"" when a guy who is going thru NS and the girl cheated him what is inside the girls mindset of them being so impatient that they can't wait for them too book out?"""
438,Aww jade is wearing Saffron’s holoq shirt 
439,Gotta love how everyone is so open 
440,I thought saffron already fly in london but maybe this episode film before she go to london..
441,Awesome episode!
442,Love this so much
443,"as a big bang stan, i completely d i e d at saff's part"
444,"Captions : ""Idk what they talking about"" "
445,4:05 what’s saffron doing HAHAHA & the editor who did the subtitling is really lit too 
446,MORE!!
447,So this is where the real talk left to... I don’t find the new cast lives up to the old cast...good to see I can get the real talk cast and format back
448,done watching! enjoyed it!
449,Matching pillow and blouse set
450,I like this video before i watch it 
451,Dew And Saffy looking good as usual
452,Munah I'm disappointed you don't want dumbledore
453,This is total chaos sia hahahaha
454,I wanna hear an episode about prenuptial agreements
455,Munah is either touching her knee/leg or her hair? Constantly
456,Definitely better than Real Talk cheating episode...hahah but love both<3
457,Don’t cheat in a relationship.  You don’t gain anything but you lose more.
458,Nice Air Jordan 1 High OG!
459,its good to have Dew. saying the male pov HAHA
460,if u notice munah always look like she got stiff neck cos she trying not to move her hair (?) lol
461,How about a topic on STD?
462,"Shoot out to all of cast from Indonesia,damn what an enjoyable arguments from all of you"
463,Tea spilled 
464,That ‘Shook pikachu’ caption 
465,Good one.
466,Let's go with Saffron's topic of polygamy/non-monogamous
467,But I like how Dew is the only realist in this discussion.
468,"lmaooooo the subbed ""boombayah"" after they all said ya @ 16:09"
469,"Cheating in a relationship is unhealthy.. If you do not want to be in a relationship with that person anymore, just break up so both parties can move on. Instead of trying to still be with that person and fulfill your own thirst for other guys/girls. That is so selfish. Marriage in the other hand is totally different from just a regular relationship, marriage is a commitment and a responsibility both have to bear. If you have desires to cheat and also cannot forego the lifestyle, don't bother to try marrying or getting married."
470,I trust my gut cause they are always right when i catch the imposters while playing among us
471,Remove censoring plsss. I want to hear all the cibais and lanchiaoossss XD
472,3:11 Dew korek hidong..k bye
473,Honestly I feel the take a video of the entire room came about cause they experienced too many cheaters in their relationship so you cant really fault them for trying to be uk assured
474,Unfortunately this is why most men have trust issues nowadays. Fun episode though
475,Whats the bg song ya at the start?? Anyone??
476,Yes. Polygamy topic pls! Hahaha or open relationship!
477,13:24 I guess the person writing the subtitles is a reveluv haha
478,Keisha what an eye candy
479,Munah is crazyy
480,Nice Jordan thatt
481,The Backstage Bunch or Just Saying?

487,HAHAHA aiyoo why everyone cheat? 
488,HHaha the arguing is funny as
489,Jade’s the best
490,15:08 Kesian the subtitles guy 
491,to me i think cheating is doing what couples do. hold hands kissing hugging fking. all these is cheating. go out with another girl but nvr do all this is totally fine.. friend only mah
492,keisha is really really beautiful 
493,cheating is cheating no label no excuse just dont commit to a relationship is not for everyone 
494,"what about dumbledore, munah?"
495,"11:10 The highest I call someone was from night 11 PM to 5 AM, it was about 689 missed calls back in 2008

PS: Am Not crazy. I was 17. I just wanted to clear a misunderstanding with my girlfriend, which we did when she woke up, received the call, called me crazy and I slept like a baby till noon."
496,"Why got alot of kpop songs in the subs haha

Someone loves their kpop"

518,"No story can beat Jade's chicken story, period. "
519,The most iconic jade story i cam never forget it 
520,Her story about the one she threw the handphone in the cinema and blaming the movie auntie for picking it up comes quite close haha
521,what was it about again
522,"Initially here for shigga shay, and quite dissappointed to see Billie Eilish as special guest instead."
523,"Shigga, if ya reading this, love ya bro"
524,Walking out of dinner in front of people your partner doesn't know very well is just so selfish. It's embarrassing for the other party and shows how you're only prioritising your own feelings.
525,I feel Jade’s pain for the white Chanel bag. It probably cost at least $8k! If I’m in her shoes I will be very pissed at my sister too no matter how much I love her
526,Good episode sia. EH SHIGGA SHAY DIDN'T EVEN END UP TELLING HIS STORY WTF MAN (it's ok still love u bro)
527,FINALLY a longer episode n the producers actually had more of a voice! Love it. Def  some good shit
528,"Btw whatever keisha is talking about is from the book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John M. Gottman and Nan Silver!

If anyone's interested!"
529,"I think Kesha's fight was very fair - imo even if I might not be the biggest birthday person myself, it's fair to assume that other people would be, or at least care a little bit about their own birthdays. Like how we celebrate birthdays for/surprise our friends. It's just a nice thing to do, and shows some thought."
530,Yesss agreed its not about the “birthday” but more so showing that this person is important to you and you want to show it
531,Keisha fangirling over Jay Park is so me lmao
532,Shigga was my senior in secondary school & I remember him performing on our school’s stage :’) Now he’s collaborating with Jay Park while I’m just a potato!!! His rap was sooo good!! & shigga morning was such a throwback hahaha
533,you're a happy potato
534,"watching you guys talk is fun! you guys have such a great vibe! it reminds me of couple of years ago where a Malay dude from Singapore came to a nightclub in my country. He was so casual, open minded & relatable."
535,One of the best episode yet! Great topic n sharing !!
536,keisha kinda killin it in that dress ngl
537,Ngl would love to see shigga be back on the talk show 
538,"i feel like a lot of men tend to do stonewalling cause theyre just not that good at expressing their feelings and they want some time to think through about what happened. anywaysssss, look at keisha she was damn annoyed with dew HAHAHA"
539,the way i learnt so many life lessons from them... amazing.
