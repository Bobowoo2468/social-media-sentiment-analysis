0,woah jade and saffron duo feels right again
1,rach l True
2,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
3,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
4,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
5,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
6,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
7,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
8,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
9,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
10,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
11,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
12,longer episodes like this are what we need
13,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
14,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
15,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe "
16,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
17,Appreciate the long episode!!!
18,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
19,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
20,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
21,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
22,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
23,YAS jade and saffron! and dew!! 
24,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3
25,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
26,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
27,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
28,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes! 
29,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
30,Im kinda curious how jade’s child is doing and how he/she looks like hehe
31,Now this is an awesome show..
32,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
33,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
34,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated "
35,Yes The OG's are back
36,"ahhhhh this feels right with the original cast of real talk minus John, real talk new cast just doesn't suit me"
37,Enjoyed this. And COMPLETELY agreed with the girls when they were schooling Dew
38,"Great to see Saff backkk!
  Aquarius queens Jade and Saff"
39,Definitely better than the current real talk
40,"I just want to be best friends with Dew and Saff man, loving the chemistry"
41,More stories from Keisha please!
42,Love the long episode! This feels right
43,your lighting setup was really dope bro!
44,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
45,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
46,Love the group dynamics

0,"Cheating is a choice made, it is not inevitable. If you can’t even control yourself and have the discipline and morale to stay loyal and committed to your partner, then I feel like you shouldn’t get into any relationship, unless it’s mutually open. (Just my opinion)."
1,Cheating is honestly the worst thing you could ever do in a marriage. Whats the point in getting married if youll end up cheating ? Just dont get committed.
2,How can u admit to cheating with a straight face lol
3,If dew says all his past gf's were insecure.... then has he considered the fact that maybe he was the problem to begin with?
4,"Of course attractive people would say cheating is not so bad or even okay. The world is their oyster and they can always find someone better out there. The rest of us who are less attractive don't have the opportunity if we wanted to, how to cheat? haha."
5,Tbh they talking about how if you feel you don’t love someone anymore then just leave but like love can be a choice to go through the good and bad with someone so i really couldnt relate on this LEL sorry man
6,"""idk la what they talking"""
7,The captions is so on point like literally
8,"I’m not ok with the boyfriend telling all his problems, especially problems in our relationship to another female friend... anyone with me?"
9,dew must do an episode about amelia though
10,Munah's neck not tired ah? Keep tilting
11,basically dun commit until the trust is there if not its just toxic af
12,Omo. The way dew touched his heart when talking about Amelia ♡
13,"Damn tbh if you're really young, you should realise feelings  are complicated and that feelings for another person come and go. Those feelings can come when you're in a relationship or when you're single, so it makes things especially complicated. Give it a few weeks and those feelings for the new person might just leave completely anyway. Munah talk talk only, wouldn't go so far as emotional cheating ala ""I really love this new guy"". If the guy interesting then can make friend what"
14,they are literally JUST SAYING anything they want. love the chaotic energy
15,"Wanna hear more about you guys’ views on polygamy AND polyamory; where to draw the line, what is and isn’t ok etc 
Keep the episodes coming love em!"
16,"Finally a new episode, would be nice if y’al talk one at a time though, its quite chaotic with everyone talking haha, just saying ;)"
17,"Be it any relationship, communication plays an important role in avoiding any unnecessary drama/problem."

19,"OMG i was waiting for a new ep for so longggggggggggggg
FINALLY"
20,"Since y'all mention abit about weird Munah's weird kinks, why not an episode about that one day?"
21,living for the chaotic energy lmao
22,Aww jade is wearing Saffron’s holoq shirt 
23,"Captions : ""Idk what they talking about"" "
24,"as a big bang stan, i completely d i e d at saff's part"
25,"Love Munah’s free passes

26,Don’t cheat in a relationship.  You don’t gain anything but you lose more.
27,Truths or not aside. Salute to all of you for the confession to the world.
28,this cast is perfection
29,Just found this channel and I love y'all!
30,"Cheating in a relationship is unhealthy.. If you do not want to be in a relationship with that person anymore, just break up so both parties can move on. Instead of trying to still be with that person and fulfill your own thirst for other guys/girls. That is so selfish. Marriage in the other hand is totally different from just a regular relationship, marriage is a commitment and a responsibility both have to bear. If you have desires to cheat and also cannot forego the lifestyle, don't bother to try marrying or getting married."
31,The pillow matching safff
32,I thought saffron already fly in london but maybe this episode film before she go to london..
33,Gotta love how everyone is so open 
34,"I have one question"" when a guy who is going thru NS and the girl cheated him what is inside the girls mindset of them being so impatient that they can't wait for them too book out?"""
35,So this is where the real talk left to... I don’t find the new cast lives up to the old cast...good to see I can get the real talk cast and format back
36,if u notice munah always look like she got stiff neck cos she trying not to move her hair (?) lol

64,cheating is cheating no label no excuse just dont commit to a relationship is not for everyone

0,"No story can beat Jade's chicken story, period. "
1,The most iconic jade story i cam never forget it

3,what was it about again
4,"Initially here for shigga shay, and quite dissappointed to see Billie Eilish as special guest instead."
5,"Shigga, if ya reading this, love ya bro"
6,I feel Jade’s pain for the white Chanel bag. It probably cost at least $8k! If I’m in her shoes I will be very pissed at my sister too no matter how much I love her
7,Good episode sia. EH SHIGGA SHAY DIDN'T EVEN END UP TELLING HIS STORY WTF MAN (it's ok still love u bro)
8,Walking out of dinner in front of people your partner doesn't know very well is just so selfish. It's embarrassing for the other party and shows how you're only prioritising your own feelings.
9,FINALLY a longer episode n the producers actually had more of a voice! Love it. Def  some good shit
10,"I think Kesha's fight was very fair - imo even if I might not be the biggest birthday person myself, it's fair to assume that other people would be, or at least care a little bit about their own birthdays. Like how we celebrate birthdays for/surprise our friends. It's just a nice thing to do, and shows some thought."
11,Yesss agreed its not about the “birthday” but more so showing that this person is important to you and you want to show it
12,"Btw whatever keisha is talking about is from the book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John M. Gottman and Nan Silver!

If anyone's interested!"
13,"watching you guys talk is fun! you guys have such a great vibe! it reminds me of couple of years ago where a Malay dude from Singapore came to a nightclub in my country. He was so casual, open minded & relatable."
14,One of the best episode yet! Great topic n sharing !!
15,Shigga was my senior in secondary school & I remember him performing on our school’s stage :’) Now he’s collaborating with Jay Park while I’m just a potato!!! His rap was sooo good!! & shigga morning was such a throwback hahaha

19,Ngl would love to see shigga be back on the talk show 
20,the way i learnt so many life lessons from them... amazing. 
21,just good vibes from this video!! Love it
22,"i feel like a lot of men tend to do stonewalling cause theyre just not that good at expressing their feelings and they want some time to think through about what happened. anywaysssss, look at keisha she was damn annoyed with dew HAHAHA"
23,Everybody needs this video in their life! I cried when keisha spoke about fighting styles and when Munah spoke at the end hahaha tell me more about the different fighting styles!
24,"I lost it when Dew shouted, JATAN KELEPEK! ROFL"
