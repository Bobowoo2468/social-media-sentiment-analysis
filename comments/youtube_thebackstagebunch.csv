98,woah jade and saffron duo feels right again
99,rach l True
100,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,longer episodes like this are what we need
109,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
110,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
111,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
116,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
117,Appreciate the long episode!!!
118,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe"
119,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
120,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
121,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes!
124,Now this is an awesome show..
125,YAS jade and saffron! and dew!!
126,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
127,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
128,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
129,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
130,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
131,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
132,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
133,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated"
134,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
135,Great to see Saff backkk!  Aquarius queens Jade and Saff
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"
137,Yes The OG's are back
138,Love the long episode! This feels right
139,"I just want to be best friends with Dew and Saff man, loving the chemistry"
140,Definitely better than the current real talk
141,More stories from Keisha please!
142,"The moment i see their faces on the couch, subscribed."
143,Enjoyed this. And COMPLETELY agreed with the girls when they were schooling Dew
144,GO KEISHA!!! I love you!!
145,CAN'T WAIT FORTHE NEXT EP!!!
146,I love how each of you all get to talk
147,AW YEAHHH new season let’s gooooo
148,Love the group dynamics
149,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
150,your lighting setup was really dope bro!
151,oh my god jade and saffron duo !!! the ogs are back im watching this guys
152,id pay for this man best content in awhile
153,"really love this, please do more !"

100,LOL. I would rather watch this than RealTalk. The chemistry here is so much better than the current casting of real talk. Dammmnn.
101,jade rasif could talk for an hour and i would be emotionally invested throughout
102,"Dew is like the ""sister"" of a hot chick group that always gets roasted"
103,Everytime i see Jade. I rmb the story she told about the fried chicken HAHAHHAAHA
104,Same sia
105,Whoa. This episode was just Dew getting schooled by the girls.
106,I want to know Munah's workout - she looks really glowy and toned!
107,This is better than real talk ever since they replace the OGs
108,longer episodes like this are what we need
109,"Munah is the best person to be a sister material, like she can give the best life advice to you."
110,"love the chemistry of the crew!!! everyone had their own screentime to share their stories and the video length is perfect! felt like i was only watching for 5min, not complaining!!"
111,"THIS IS THE BEST CONTENT SINCE A REALLY LONG TIME . 

Thanks the crew and members making it . Dang DEW SAFFY JADE n the OG flirtatious women n Keisha . I love y’alll"
112,"‘i was 19 he was 5 years older than me’
dew: counts 5 on his fingers
also dew: “23”"
113,he was probably 23 going 24
114,Ikr it's 24 leh HAHAHA
115,"This needs more views !!
Thanks, for bringing back the old group and love these 2 new lovely ladies."
116,Munah gives such good advice I’m so happy she’s on this series!
117,Appreciate the long episode!!!
118,"Dew: 'Mashaallah I thought HE was insecure!' 

Damn i really like this new Dew vibe"
119,rlly love how they talk like they're catching up with one another or like jsut sharing their truest feelings about things without even censoring names when they talk abt it (just edited out for privacy purposes) IT MAKES EVERYTH SO REAL and not curated just for content purposes LOVE IT!!!
120,This is by far better than real talk. Keep up the content dew and gang
121,love this please dont ever end this channel!!! love saff jade munahhhh <3
122,WOW :o Looking forward to this series.
123,Love the camera work and sitting arrangement and vibes!
124,Now this is an awesome show..
125,YAS jade and saffron! and dew!!
126,"Yooo 17 mins! Keep it up, looking forward to future episodes!"
127,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee"
128,So this is where u guys are hiding. That other grp in realtalk bores me.. Subbed right away
129,The chemistry between the cast is so harmonious and smooth. Edits are apt and not abrupt. Not complaining about the visuals too.
130,"Dew has his work cut out for him with this new show. All these girls are crazy, man."
131,i really love Jade i swear to god I love her personality
132,now thisss feels like the real talk i want in my subscription
133,"i really love the trio between dew, jade and saffron... lowkey better than the current real talk now tho... like the energy they have can't be replicated"
134,Munah is back!! Love the queen and put together with the gang... just wished there was Hirzi so he can stir shit up with his psychological questions and shit. Pls one episode have Hirzi come on
135,Great to see Saff backkk!  Aquarius queens Jade and Saff
136,"im so happy and grateful for this show, y'all have no idea"

138,Love the long episode! This feels right
139,"I just want to be best friends with Dew and Saff man, loving the chemistry"

141,More stories from Keisha please!
142,"The moment i see their faces on the couch, subscribed."
143,Enjoyed this. And COMPLETELY agreed with the girls when they were schooling Dew
144,GO KEISHA!!! I love you!!
145,CAN'T WAIT FORTHE NEXT EP!!!
146,I love how each of you all get to talk
147,AW YEAHHH new season let’s gooooo
148,Love the group dynamics
149,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future)."
150,your lighting setup was really dope bro!
151,oh my god jade and saffron duo !!! the ogs are back im watching this guys
