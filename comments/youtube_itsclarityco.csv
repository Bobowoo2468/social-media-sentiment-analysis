0,"100% agree with Azura. Personally, no kid should feel obliged to ""repay"" their parents if their parents were unable to meet the needs of their children. I think a lot of people misconstrued the concept of parenting as babysitting. To just financially support your child and not meet the emotional needs of the child is not proper parenting, it basically means that you were a great babysitter. So when it comes to obligations, I think it's ultimately a personal choice. I reckon people who lived with abusive and emotionally negligent parents do end up having to heal from their own traumas which they didn't ask for. Ultimately, being a parent should be a thankless job and people should probably put in more thought into it i.e have better planning (being able to afford your own retirement before you even consider having children). Just my two cents (:"
1,"The part where you mentioned “Your parents didn’t leave you when you were young. So you don’t leave them when they’re old” can we reflect back to that statement. What if they MENTALLY left us? Sure they were just there “Physically” but what if they left mentally. As kids, we love it when parents showered us with encouragement and support. So even if they’re just physically in presence but never there mentally, how would you explain that?"
2,"Filial piety, to me, is different at different stages of my life. When I'm still a school-going kid/teen, filial piety is respecting them, honouring them, and being obedient or at least respectfully explaining my views to them if our opinions differ. As I grow up and start working and earning my keep, on top of all those mentioned previously, need to give them monthly allowance while still providing for myself and my family if I'm married. But as they grow older and become more sickly and need closer care and supervision, then filial piety to me is putting them before myself. Sacrificing my own needs to ensure that all their living and healthcare needs are met."
3,"my relationship w my parents is distant and there are resentment built up growing up. My thought are fixed on not taking much from them since young with the mindset of staying on my own which came to be. I paid for my own education and never demanded for anything.  Therefore, I feel like i dont owe them anything. Unhealed trauma does not support filial piety."
4,Same
5,Oh sorry to hear that. You had a bad childhood compared with others.
6,"agree soo much with azura's opinions :'-)

thank you for giving a voice to those whose parents expect their children to support them even if they were not great parents (gambling, abusive etc) themselves. its damn unfair to expect the children to do alot more for their parents when they are alr struggling / their parents didn't even treat them well when they were growing up. 

my parents never gave allowance to my grandparents, gambled all their lives and never saved a single cent, were abusive parents who didnt support me thru my education. is it rly rly my responsibility to give them monthly allowance now that im working? i am still giving la, but i just know deep down that its not my responsibility bc they werent responsible/great parents.


i think gahmen imposes expectations (maintenance of parents act) that children should take care of their parents so that these old folks dont 'burden' the society. looking at western countries, they are more supportive of pension benefits but our country has none of that, so gahmen has got confucian values to impose on youngsters who are alr struggling with their day-to-day expenses (@ inflation all-time-high lol)"
7,Agree
8,"Then you only have yourself to blame, since this is the path you chose"
9,"I enjoy the insightful and rather detailed discussion on the topic. Thanks also for staying on topic. There are so man podcasts which drift off topic after awhile.
To add my two cents, expecting the government to take care of the basic needs of our parents (elderlies), is asking for too much. As the children, we should take care of their basic needs IF they need. The government has done their job by writing policies to ensure the elderlies are taken care of on a macro scale. E.g. CPF, medisave, CHAS etc."
10,"To support parents with basic necessities is a moral responsibility. Branded goods, holidays, country club membership etc they can jolly well fund themselves."
11,Every child deserves their parent but not every parent deserves their children.
12,Thanks for the podcasts. I’m just a newcomer here but find it useful to watch ur videos. I like the ways the girls break things down and analyze them. It’s so informative and insightful. I really love it. <3
13,Thanks for listening and discovering our podcast! Glad you enjoyed it! 
14,Really like this session that explores a lot of options that we can consider to help ourselves and our elderly parents. Thank you

18,"One helpful way, is to make it fun is to get your parents to do the love language test. Who says the test is only for couples? When you can find out your parents' love language, you can maximize your time and also convey your love more accurately. This way there won't be any misunderstandings and also it sort of will make your life more organized and productive this way. "
19,"Love the sound of this idea 
 Thanks for sharing May!"
20,"Good content unlike some local channels always come up with lame contents. Only fans interview, etc etc, lane."
21,"Point to note here is that Maintenance of Parents act is only used at the most extreme of situations. That’s why you hardly ever hear it being used and the when it is used, the verdict is such that children don’t give obscene amounts. Like filial piety, the law is laid out there, but then there are a bunch of folks that like to misuse these concepts and hit their children hard. Eg. If you don’t give me $x you are unfilial,I can sue you. But if it’s a gambler parent, this law does not applies. And Confucius does explain that in such a situation you don’t have to feed your parents demands (愚孝), instead the filial way to correct them. But Confucius has one requirement for this, he says correct them respectfully."
22,ชอบมากๆๆๆ
23,Elderly parents are entitled to monthly family support from their adult children in Singapore by law
24,"If parents should not expect children to fund their luxuries (e.g. Rolex watch) when they are old, then children should also not expect parents to fund their luxuries (e.g. concert tickets, expensive smartphones, branded clothes/shoes/accessories) when they were young. Thoughts?"

30,"Why Germaine act stupid when Azura said ""reap what you sow"" XD then followed by the low blow about the law to demand money from their children. Damn strange. She cannot accept opposing views ah? siao"
31,"As a boss of a family business, whenever my staffs take childcare leave on top of all their sick leave and paid leaves, i just feel like its very unfair for my company to bear the expenses of their absence. they aren't working but we still have to pay them and on top of that we have to pay OT to the staff thats taking over the staff on leave. It's not that i don't have any compassion, but if the government want to implement leaves, they should endorse the company with the lost financial cost to compensate, instead of the company tanking it for themselves. if it's a big company it should be fine but a small family business like mine loses out alot. what rly triggered me was the covid-19 issue. Government actually allow staffs to take 1 week paid leave outside of their original paid leave (21 paid leave a yr) without a doctor letter and without any evidence they actually got covid. they dont have to work for 1 week and they get paid. its extremely detrimental to the company cuz if everyone abuses this covid thing, they can go up to half a year of absence and still get paid. the government needs to pay these companies their loses instead of just asking companies to ""suck it up, have compassion"". HOW ABOUT, the government give us companies some compassion instead?? Doing a business is far from easy already and now the government is just telling us to ""suck it up since you are so rich right?"""

1,Love you girls..i laughed so much and  appreciated all nfo shared here.
2,Good discussion
3,"29:25 For those who drive, I would suggest that maybe you want to discount the fact that you drive when you consider the location of the house that you're buying. Because, what if farther down the down, you want to switch to public transport? Or our car policies change and it becomes ridiculously expensive to drive, or it no longer makes sense to drive? So don't put too much weight on the fact that you drive. I was lucky. When I bought my current place, my friend was telling me how convenient public transport here is, but we both also acknowledge that it didn't really matter since I drove. Now that I no longer see the sense in owning a car, I'm so grateful that I'm well-connected as far as public transport is concerned. Phew..."
4,"That's a good point! PD here - who is one of those who drives, and like you, I deliberately chose a home close to public transport :) I would have preferred a quieter place, away from the loud sound of buses and cars, but that may have come with inconveniences. However, I understand that some people cannot compromise a quiet neighbourhood for a slightly 'noisier' one. It's a trade-off, so it's completely understandable. "

8,"No, the owning mindset didn't start with our parents, grandparents. It was started by our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Back when SG first turned independent, he needed to forge a unity amongst the different races and immigrants. He felt that home ownership would give the people, regardless of their race, culture and origins, a sense of belonging and loyalty, and a feeling of being invested in the future success of the country. So he made it a national policy for the population to buy public housing instead of renting from the HDB. It wasn't so much a desire by our fore-fathers to own a home but rather, it was policy back then."
9,"@sleepy_dobe

Sometimes in all honesty,  I wonder which planet these LKY worshipers came from?! You make it sound like all our ancestors don’t have a good head on their shoulders and “ONLY” Demi God Lee Kuan Yew had that foresight to implement this “home ownership” policy. 
️ 

OWNING one’s OWN home IS STILL and will ALWAYS be the aspiration and INSTINCT of any independent minded individual. You don’t need a rocket scientist to figure that out. Do you know how many of Singaporean’s grandparents back in the day SOLD their land At A DISCOUNTED rate to the government to build HDBs??! How is LKY going to justify not allowing people to at least own their own homes!"
10,Germaine is so cute about the HDB calculator......lol

15,"neighbour from hell HAHAHA! YOU COME DOWN NOW 

Jokes aside, imo there's a world where renting does make sense over getting a mortgage. But rents now are abit crazy (might be an understatement), but yea for most, BTO is the way."
16,"Singaporeans are asset-rich, cash-poor.......lol."
0,"wow i remember looking up to them 9 years ago when i was in netball, and now they are mothers!!"
1,Really ?? I have no idea who they are.
2,"watching this podcast reminds me of myself when i was a child. I also had an ambitious mom who worked the entire day and people were always saying things (as the host hazelle has done here too) like it's ""needed"" for moms to send the kid to infant care (or in my case, left in the hands of FDWs). My sibling and I grew up to be neglected kids who have issues with intimacy, and I don't want my future kids to go through the same thing. The truth is that it's not necessarily ""needed"" to sacrifice time with the kid! You always have a choice - sometimes it means having to give up a job or interest if you prioritise the child. On a systemic level, I think Sg is also not the most family-friendly place to work in this respect."
3,thank you for sharing your personal experience with us! There's definitely no right or wrong way to parent (and no manual given!). What's most important is for us to find the right balance for your own family. 
4,"This episode was really inspiring to watch! Not just from the guests Char & Qi, but the questions and replies imposed by the 3 hosts as well. 
 From a lady to another lady - such experiences are gonna be felt by literally any modern lady going through motherhood  right now or prior to the future. Even if it's not ourselves, it could be a feeling for a close sister/friend. 
 It's wholesome to see these ladies get the support system they need while also pursuing their endeavours.

This is a shout out to all the women who are juggling multiple things right now in their lives. We are all in this together. "
5,"My friend is a girl national rock climber here in Malaysia, and she's also a national athlete in obstacle course racing. 

Through her and the things she shared last time, I realized that women athletes or women in general can multitask very well, but have it harder. The recognition and pay are lower for women, and women have to deal with the changes in energy and how their performance is affected because of the menstrual cycle."

5,Why didn’t anyone ask about her skincare routine esp her sunscreen habit hahah!! Her skin looks flawless 
6,"personally you would find that the warrant officers in the army (those who started off as lowly sergeants) have much better communication and leadership skills, because they needed to demonstrate these to rise up the ranks amongst the many. officers dont have these same opportunities or ""hardships"" to develop the same soft skills, as most go through the officer course from the start based on school results. so if you want a different more grounded perspective, speak to a warrant officer (someone who has proven ability over the years). officers, with the greatest respect, are usually sheltered from the dark side of the military - such as army rigidity and toxic organisational culture (they are the creators of and not the ones being subjected to military culture)."
7,"I fully support female conscription for Singaporean National Service!!!

16,"Singapore’s high rank structures are based solely on educational levels. Not Combat experience and exposures.
