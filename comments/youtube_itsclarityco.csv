0,"100% agree with Azura. Personally, no kid should feel obliged to ""repay"" their parents if their parents were unable to meet the needs of their children. I think a lot of people misconstrued the concept of parenting as babysitting. To just financially support your child and not meet the emotional needs of the child is not proper parenting, it basically means that you were a great babysitter. So when it comes to obligations, I think it's ultimately a personal choice. I reckon people who lived with abusive and emotionally negligent parents do end up having to heal from their own traumas which they didn't ask for. Ultimately, being a parent should be a thankless job and people should probably put in more thought into it i.e have better planning (being able to afford your own retirement before you even consider having children). Just my two cents (:"
1,"The part where you mentioned “Your parents didn’t leave you when you were young. So you don’t leave them when they’re old” can we reflect back to that statement. What if they MENTALLY left us? Sure they were just there “Physically” but what if they left mentally. As kids, we love it when parents showered us with encouragement and support. So even if they’re just physically in presence but never there mentally, how would you explain that?"
2,"Filial piety, to me, is different at different stages of my life. When I'm still a school-going kid/teen, filial piety is respecting them, honouring them, and being obedient or at least respectfully explaining my views to them if our opinions differ. As I grow up and start working and earning my keep, on top of all those mentioned previously, need to give them monthly allowance while still providing for myself and my family if I'm married. But as they grow older and become more sickly and need closer care and supervision, then filial piety to me is putting them before myself. Sacrificing my own needs to ensure that all their living and healthcare needs are met."
3,"agree soo much with azura's opinions :'-)

thank you for giving a voice to those whose parents expect their children to support them even if they were not great parents (gambling, abusive etc) themselves. its damn unfair to expect the children to do alot more for their parents when they are alr struggling / their parents didn't even treat them well when they were growing up."

42,"No, the owning mindset didn't start with our parents, grandparents. It was started by our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Back when SG first turned independent, he needed to forge a unity amongst the different races and immigrants. He felt that home ownership would give the people, regardless of their race, culture and origins, a sense of belonging and loyalty, and a feeling of being invested in the future success of the country. So he made it a national policy for the population to buy public housing instead of renting from the HDB. It wasn't so much a desire by our fore-fathers to own a home but rather, it was policy back then."
43,"@sleepy_dobe

Sometimes in all honesty,  I wonder which planet these LKY worshipers came from?! You make it sound like all our ancestors don’t have a good head on their shoulders and “ONLY” Demi God Lee Kuan Yew had that foresight to implement this “home ownership” policy. 
️ 

OWNING one’s OWN home IS STILL and will ALWAYS be the aspiration and INSTINCT of any independent minded individual. You don’t need a rocket scientist to figure that out. Do you know how many of Singaporean’s grandparents back in the day SOLD their land At A DISCOUNTED rate to the government to build HDBs??! How is LKY going to justify not allowing people to at least own their own homes!"
44,"29:25 For those who drive, I would suggest that maybe you want to discount the fact that you drive when you consider the location of the house that you're buying. Because, what if farther down the down, you want to switch to public transport? Or our car policies change and it becomes ridiculously expensive to drive, or it no longer makes sense to drive? So don't put too much weight on the fact that you drive. I was lucky. When I bought my current place, my friend was telling me how convenient public transport here is, but we both also acknowledge that it didn't really matter since I drove. Now that I no longer see the sense in owning a car, I'm so grateful that I'm well-connected as far as public transport is concerned. Phew..."
45,"That's a good point! PD here - who is one of those who drives, and like you, I deliberately chose a home close to public transport :) I would have preferred a quieter place, away from the loud sound of buses and cars, but that may have come with inconveniences. However, I understand that some people cannot compromise a quiet neighbourhood for a slightly 'noisier' one. It's a trade-off, so it's completely understandable."

54,Really ?? I have no idea who they are.
55,"watching this podcast reminds me of myself when i was a child. I also had an ambitious mom who worked the entire day and people were always saying things (as the host hazelle has done here too) like it's ""needed"" for moms to send the kid to infant care (or in my case, left in the hands of FDWs). My sibling and I grew up to be neglected kids who have issues with intimacy, and I don't want my future kids to go through the same thing. The truth is that it's not necessarily ""needed"" to sacrifice time with the kid! You always have a choice - sometimes it means having to give up a job or interest if you prioritise the child.

0,"100% agree with Azura. Personally, no kid should feel obliged to ""repay"" their parents if their parents were unable to meet the needs of their children. I think a lot of people misconstrued the concept of parenting as babysitting. To just financially support your child and not meet the emotional needs of the child is not proper parenting, it basically means that you were a great babysitter. So when it comes to obligations, I think it's ultimately a personal choice. I reckon people who lived with abusive and emotionally negligent parents do end up having to heal from their own traumas which they didn't ask for. Ultimately, being a parent should be a thankless job and people should probably put in more thought into it i.e have better planning (being able to afford your own retirement before you even consider having children). Just my two cents (:"
1,"The part where you mentioned “Your parents didn’t leave you when you were young. So you don’t leave them when they’re old” can we reflect back to that statement. What if they MENTALLY left us? Sure they were just there “Physically” but what if they left mentally. As kids, we love it when parents showered us with encouragement and support. So even if they’re just physically in presence but never there mentally, how would you explain that?"
2,"Filial piety, to me, is different at different stages of my life. When I'm still a school-going kid/teen, filial piety is respecting them, honouring them, and being obedient or at least respectfully explaining my views to them if our opinions differ. As I grow up and start working and earning my keep, on top of all those mentioned previously, need to give them monthly allowance while still providing for myself and my family if I'm married. But as they grow older and become more sickly and need closer care and supervision, then filial piety to me is putting them before myself. Sacrificing my own needs to ensure that all their living and healthcare needs are met."
3,"agree soo much with azura's opinions :'-)

thank you for giving a voice to those whose parents expect their children to support them even if they were not great parents (gambling, abusive etc) themselves. its damn unfair to expect the children to do alot more for their parents when they are alr struggling / their parents didn't even treat them well when they were growing up."
4,Agree

6,"my relationship w my parents is distant and there are resentment built up growing up. My thought are fixed on not taking much from them since young with the mindset of staying on my own which came to be. I paid for my own education and never demanded for anything.  Therefore, I feel like i dont owe them anything. Unhealed trauma does not support filial piety."
7,Same
8,Oh sorry to hear that. You had a bad childhood compared with others.
9,"I enjoy the insightful and rather detailed discussion on the topic. Thanks also for staying on topic. There are so man podcasts which drift off topic after awhile.
To add my two cents, expecting the government to take care of the basic needs of our parents (elderlies), is asking for too much. As the children, we should take care of their basic needs IF they need. The government has done their job by writing policies to ensure the elderlies are taken care of on a macro scale. E.g. CPF, medisave, CHAS etc."

It's not that i don't have any compassion, but if the government want to implement leaves, they should endorse the company with the lost financial cost to compensate, instead of the company tanking it for themselves. if it's a big company it should be fine but a small family business like mine loses out alot. what rly triggered me was the covid-19 issue. Government actually allow staffs to take 1 week paid leave outside of their original paid leave (21 paid leave a yr) without a doctor letter and without any evidence they actually got covid. they dont have to work for 1 week and they get paid. its extremely detrimental to the company cuz if everyone abuses this covid thing, they can go up to half a year of absence and still get paid. the government needs to pay these companies their loses instead of just asking companies to ""suck it up, have compassion"".

42,"No, the owning mindset didn't start with our parents, grandparents. It was started by our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Back when SG first turned independent, he needed to forge a unity amongst the different races and immigrants. He felt that home ownership would give the people, regardless of their race, culture and origins, a sense of belonging and loyalty, and a feeling of being invested in the future success of the country. So he made it a national policy for the population to buy public housing instead of renting from the HDB. It wasn't so much a desire by our fore-fathers to own a home but rather, it was policy back then."
43,"@sleepy_dobe

Sometimes in all honesty,  I wonder which planet these LKY worshipers came from?! You make it sound like all our ancestors don’t have a good head on their shoulders and “ONLY” Demi God Lee Kuan Yew had that foresight to implement this “home ownership” policy. 
️ 

OWNING one’s OWN home IS STILL and will ALWAYS be the aspiration and INSTINCT of any independent minded individual. You don’t need a rocket scientist to figure that out. Do you know how many of Singaporean’s grandparents back in the day SOLD their land At A DISCOUNTED rate to the government to build HDBs??! How is LKY going to justify not allowing people to at least own their own homes!"
44,"29:25 For those who drive, I would suggest that maybe you want to discount the fact that you drive when you consider the location of the house that you're buying. Because, what if farther down the down, you want to switch to public transport? Or our car policies change and it becomes ridiculously expensive to drive, or it no longer makes sense to drive? So don't put too much weight on the fact that you drive. I was lucky. When I bought my current place, my friend was telling me how convenient public transport here is, but we both also acknowledge that it didn't really matter since I drove. Now that I no longer see the sense in owning a car, I'm so grateful that I'm well-connected as far as public transport is concerned. Phew..."
45,"That's a good point! PD here - who is one of those who drives, and like you, I deliberately chose a home close to public transport :) I would have preferred a quieter place, away from the loud sound of buses and cars, but that may have come with inconveniences. However, I understand that some people cannot compromise a quiet neighbourhood for a slightly 'noisier' one. It's a trade-off, so it's completely understandable."

I also had an ambitious mom who worked the entire day and people were always saying things (as the host hazelle has done here too) like it's ""needed"" for moms to send the kid to infant care (or in my case, left in the hands of FDWs). My sibling and I grew up to be neglected kids who have issues with intimacy, and I don't want my future kids to go through the same thing. The truth is that it's not necessarily ""needed"" to sacrifice time with the kid! You always have a choice - sometimes it means having to give up a job or interest if you prioritise the child. On a systemic level, I think Sg is also not the most family-friendly place to work in this respect."

70,"personally you would find that the warrant officers in the army (those who started off as lowly sergeants) have much better communication and leadership skills, because they needed to demonstrate these to rise up the ranks amongst the many. officers dont have these same opportunities or ""hardships"" to develop the same soft skills, as most go through the officer course from the start based on school results. so if you want a different more grounded perspective, speak to a warrant officer (someone who has proven ability over the years). officers, with the greatest respect, are usually sheltered from the dark side of the military - such as army rigidity and toxic organisational culture (they are the creators of and not the ones being subjected to military culture)."

And if it is a question for you to take care of your parents or not
Then you don't deserve your parents"

41,Germaine is so cute about the HDB calculator......lol
42,"No, the owning mindset didn't start with our parents, grandparents. It was started by our founding father, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Back when SG first turned independent, he needed to forge a unity amongst the different races and immigrants. He felt that home ownership would give the people, regardless of their race, culture and origins, a sense of belonging and loyalty, and a feeling of being invested in the future success of the country. So he made it a national policy for the population to buy public housing instead of renting from the HDB. It wasn't so much a desire by our fore-fathers to own a home but rather, it was policy back then."
43,"@sleepy_dobe

Sometimes in all honesty,  I wonder which planet these LKY worshipers came from?! You make it sound like all our ancestors don’t have a good head on their shoulders and “ONLY” Demi God Lee Kuan Yew had that foresight to implement this “home ownership” policy. 
️ 

OWNING one’s OWN home IS STILL and will ALWAYS be the aspiration and INSTINCT of any independent minded individual. You don’t need a rocket scientist to figure that out. Do you know how many of Singaporean’s grandparents back in the day SOLD their land At A DISCOUNTED rate to the government to build HDBs??! How is LKY going to justify not allowing people to at least own their own homes!"
44,"29:25 For those who drive, I would suggest that maybe you want to discount the fact that you drive when you consider the location of the house that you're buying. Because, what if farther down the down, you want to switch to public transport? Or our car policies change and it becomes ridiculously expensive to drive, or it no longer makes sense to drive? So don't put too much weight on the fact that you drive. I was lucky. When I bought my current place, my friend was telling me how convenient public transport here is, but we both also acknowledge that it didn't really matter since I drove. Now that I no longer see the sense in owning a car, I'm so grateful that I'm well-connected as far as public transport is concerned. Phew..."
45,"That's a good point! PD here - who is one of those who drives, and like you, I deliberately chose a home close to public transport :) I would have preferred a quieter place, away from the loud sound of buses and cars, but that may have come with inconveniences. However, I understand that some people cannot compromise a quiet neighbourhood for a slightly 'noisier' one. It's a trade-off, so it's completely understandable."
46,"18:37 note, Bil Gates became a Billionaire when he was 32 years old"
47,Hey hush crew
48,Hey
49,All stay together problem solved haha
50,"neighbour from hell HAHAHA! YOU COME DOWN NOW 

Jokes aside, imo there's a world where renting does make sense over getting a mortgage. But rents now are abit crazy (might be an understatement), but yea for most, BTO is the way."
51,
52,"Singaporeans are asset-rich, cash-poor.......lol."
53,"wow i remember looking up to them 9 years ago when i was in netball, and now they are mothers!!"
54,Really ?? I have no idea who they are.
55,"watching this podcast reminds me of myself when i was a child. I also had an ambitious mom who worked the entire day and people were always saying things (as the host hazelle has done here too) like it's ""needed"" for moms to send the kid to infant care (or in my case, left in the hands of FDWs). My sibling and I grew up to be neglected kids who have issues with intimacy, and I don't want my future kids to go through the same thing. The truth is that it's not necessarily ""needed"" to sacrifice time with the kid! You always have a choice - sometimes it means having to give up a job or interest if you prioritise the child. On a systemic level, I think Sg is also not the most family-friendly place to work in this respect."
56,thank you for sharing your personal experience with us! There's definitely no right or wrong way to parent (and no manual given!). What's most important is for us to find the right balance for your own family.
57,"This episode was really inspiring to watch! Not just from the guests Char & Qi, but the questions and replies imposed by the 3 hosts as well. 
 From a lady to another lady - such experiences are gonna be felt by literally any modern lady going through motherhood  right now or prior to the future. Even if it's not ourselves, it could be a feeling for a close sister/friend. 
 It's wholesome to see these ladies get the support system they need while also pursuing their endeavours.

This is a shout out to all the women who are juggling multiple things right now in their lives. We are all in this together."
58,
59,"My friend is a girl national rock climber here in Malaysia, and she's also a national athlete in obstacle course racing. 

Through her and the things she shared last time, I realized that women athletes or women in general can multitask very well, but have it harder. The recognition and pay are lower for women, and women have to deal with the changes in energy and how their performance is affected because of the menstrual cycle."
60,Can make a lot of money?
61,We will always support you all. Keep working hard.
62,Btw they retired?
63,Do they make alot of money???

66,"Ma'am Jin Hui used to be my BSO around 2020-2021, she's always very caring and motivates troopers who seem to lag behind during trainings, she's also a very good leader. I'm glad I see some people I know and respect from my NS days famous :)"
67,Hard to find real leaders with empathy nowadays. Respect to her !
68,"She’s a role model for women! I already like her as a person by listening to this podcast 
 she’s so strong and yet caring, if I have a daughter I hope she’ll be like her~"
69,Why didn’t anyone ask about her skincare routine esp her sunscreen habit hahah!! Her skin looks flawless
70,"personally you would find that the warrant officers in the army (those who started off as lowly sergeants) have much better communication and leadership skills, because they needed to demonstrate these to rise up the ranks amongst the many. officers dont have these same opportunities or ""hardships"" to develop the same soft skills, as most go through the officer course from the start based on school results. so if you want a different more grounded perspective, speak to a warrant officer (someone who has proven ability over the years). officers, with the greatest respect, are usually sheltered from the dark side of the military - such as army rigidity and toxic organisational culture (they are the creators of and not the ones being subjected to military culture)."
71,"I fully support female conscription for Singaporean National Service!!! 
 It's 2023 girls can and should do it too!"
72,Agree. Ladies should do national service. I have alot of very capable women around me and I can see the values they bring into the service.
73,"Israel: ""Hold my beer."""
74,Since SAF was modeled after IDF originally I think this is a brilliant idea I’m sure our women would benefit and would not mind just a short stint 3-6 months
75,Let’s gooooo
76,@Coachchuateckguan  So basically still discriminating and giving them an easier time. Good idea at furthering equality.
77,"Limited budget. So between men and women, the government would get men to do it."
78,"@slaiyfershin u can shit on inequality, but gotta accept the biological differences between the 2 genders"
79,"@notenoughcalories  sure. Accept it and treat accordingly then. Do national service or harder national service then get proportionate returns for time and effort. Not give volunteer NS or if it ever happens, easier female NS, and frame it like it's equal service. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too."
80,"Singapore’s high rank structures are based solely on educational levels. Not Combat experience and exposures. 

You’ll be surprised that some of the most decorated and respected soldiers in the US Military are actually corporals and sergeants whom had seen front line actions and life and death situations first hand. Not some officers whom simply has a degree or a so called “scholar”.."
81,I rather my country soldiers have no real combat experience and stay that way. A war won without fighting is true victory.
82,"@choonkeonglim6178 

Commentable but idealistic…"
83,@Callsign-Blade_RunnerSG naive tbh
84,"@rom8949  I am from Singapore,  served 2 years 4mths of conscription and I would not like to be activated for anything. We gained independence without having to fight for it and this I am glad. War will only cause economic losses and lives. Singapore's strength is her economy and I hope it stays that way."
85,"Yea, no choice, right? Since we don't fight wars"
86,"It boils down how much love, respect , dignity and trust to  soldiers regardless on whether career or full time nsf/nsmen."
87,Salute to all our female military personnel. Thank you for your service!
88,its universal once you don a uniform there is a bond for life..
89,"NS really brings us men together... and in fact, it transcends generations...

I had the privilege of chancing upon a Gen 1 army combat engineer officer.. u know back the where SG didn't really have the best of equipment? Yea.. those days..

We bonded cos we were combat engineers and went through the same kind of training.. handling explosives, learning how to lay mines, how to construct a base of ops for vehicles, etc... 

It's really heart warming and fun"
90,this girl got biceps
91,shall do podcast with Singapore 1st female fighter pilot too
92,The way of talking so nice she is so fit
93,20:39 I'm here
94,She is a trained counsellor too
95,"cant believe i am hearing about how ""understanding"" the commanders are."
96,Get with times. No every commander's an asshole. Sorry you had your negative impressions and experiences
97,"I have served my time and am on my 8th reservist cycle.honestly the army didn’t change much, many will attest to it. Did you even serve?

Nobody said every commander is an asshole, neither is it a bed of roses. I wanted to illustrate that to base your career in the arm forces, u need to have certain liking for it and the organisation is certainly NOT accommodating."
98,"@jackkua3717  did I even serve, huh?"
99,"@jackkua3717  Sounds like infantry, if I am wrong, doesnt matter. My unit has been very accommodating."
100,"@oncewewerewolves  What do you mean ""get with the times""? What rubbish are you spouting? You clerk isit? Or IMT operator?"
101,@yueshijoorya601  clerk only la. Not like your. keyboard general
102,"@oncewewerewolves  
 you the best keyboard warrior here, little buddy."
103,There are not many female regular soldiers in armour units esp for armout operator. Think I roughly know who Azura's friend is hehe.  (appeared in the news before)
104,"28:17 But Germaine, you said earlier that you don't like being in the sun, so how to sign on and forge a career in the SAF? Lol......

By the way, I also don't like being in the sun these days. Way too hot.....my migraine gets triggered too often nowadays. I remember during my last few reservist trainings, my head was permanently wet during field camps...lol. Have to keep it cool to minimise the chances of triggering my migraine."
105,"Signals is a much more reasonable vocation for women, since infantry is so reliant on human strength. Whereas Signals is a much more technical vocation"
106,Subtitle please! 🥹🥹
107,Wow. Would never enlist voluntarily in the army. 2 years + 10 cycles is more than enough for a lifetime.
108,Parents used to bring up whether we our male children got manage to flirt with any female nurse since we used work in the hospital environment.
109,Wow i love her voice and physique
110,"I am a guy but because of my PES status (PES E), I didn't go through BMT in Tekong. I have ORDed for nearly 9 years already and wasn't called up for a single reservist. 

My BMT was a 1-month stay-out at Kranji Camp III, then I went to MINDEF HQ for my unit life. I didn't even need to wear uniform once I entered my unit, I could wear civilian clothes. Therefore, my NS life felt like a 2-year internship. 

So when guys talk about their NS life, I can't relate at all because I didn't go through the typical experience. HAHAHA."
111,Beautiful without makeup.
112,Women power
113,Der hauptmann female version
114,I think the girl who never serve shld keep quiet and actually let the servicewoman talk
115,Hormat SAF !
116,all women should served ns...

121,"Many thanks to the police for going after many opposition-related members for criminal offences - pritam, faisal, charles yeo, lim tean, hsien yang, etc."
122,Haha listening to them talking about having more females in the army without considering the impact. Logistically etc. yes females have valuable impact in some vocations however thinking about the studies of performance of mixed units vs purely males there’s no question having females in unit produces a decrease in performance.
123,rule the kitchen
124,Are you sure it’s a real woman
125,Smart officer in between a bunch of look good no brainers-.-

130,How much money they earns???
131,"It’s not just full time athelete that needs to sacrifice much. This applies to anyone, be it a nurse, a concert pianist or even construction worker, they are also sacrificing much of their time on practicing , working long hours, etc."
