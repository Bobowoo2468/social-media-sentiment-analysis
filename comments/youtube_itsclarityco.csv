31,Shanise has toxic habits but lowkey seems like a matured person for her age
32,"this topic i feel treads on dangerous grounds which thankfully managed to steer away from becoming a toxic debate. too many perspectives and approaches, boys and girls approach this differently, character also plays a part. introverts and extroverts and generation also plays a part. 

22:16-23:00... the risk is being led on to the point of no return where you end up having your emotions crumpled and you being a like a carpet stepped all over."

46,"Love this episode , feeling inspired just from listening to what Shah has to say. Keep up the good work Wello."

110,Issit me or alyph sound lil bit like scarface  Tony Montana. Say hello to my lil friend
111,Pergh
112,its rlly surprising how similar sham and juff are…rlly proud of them both for overcoming what they went through…its true what they say that most of the time ur enemy are the ones that are the most similar to you…all the best to them both for the fight and may the better boxer win
113,I feel Juff has a very likeable personality. Nice person vibes. All the best for the fight bro
114,"the last segment was really like a big hug man :) thankyou mat for sharing your experience, really glad i spent 2 hours watching this episode"
115,"I'm looking forward for both Jufri & Sham to berdamai... whilst the world is coming to an end stop fighting guys...

& jujur dari tutur kata both of u in this interview both of u still have care & love of each other. U both may not know that ada yg sengaja nak laga² kan both of u..."
116,The anxiety part is seriously on point. Only those who go through it will know
117,"been supportng wello since 2019 bro , best duo"
118,"He gotta do more songs bro, he got a good voice"

120,️️️
121,@WELLOshow  terlampau suka sampai rasa macam nak mati
122,i think both of them (juffri and sham) kene datang balik dekat wello after the fight. just an opinion
123,"The last part is nice. My depression is the suffer in silence kind. And when it hits hard, I don't have anyone who reaches out and no one to reach out to.. Its just a vicious cycle."
124,Let’s go! #teamjuffri!
125,good episode!
126,Finally it’s both sides!
127,Yala this was 2 days ago which is Sunday.. they speak Malay on Sunday rite?

136,"Love the interview with sham, was anticipating to watch this too. However i can't understand malay :("
137,I was waiting for him to converse in English but he didn't
138,As a Malaysian listener can i know what a matrep isim lost cause I thought it’s mat rempit as we call in malaysia
139,aku dengar dua dua berbual its lowkey orang around them yang provoke abe they misunderstood each other abe end up gaduh because of the barber
140,apa description pmpn tu
141,Can consider subtitles for the malay speaking part my Gs
142,"mengarut sia juffri ni. kejap kata sham buat content sebijik sama dia, sekejap kata shah Iskandar cakap content sama, sekejap kata tak kisah sama tapi kata video template sebijik dia. Lepastu buat buat tanya Barber mana satu. Petik semua nama nak cakap org side dia. hahahahha"
143,"bro my heart felt words, you guys needs speak more english to cater to the general public man."
144,Because cd and police many malay. So they call Abang2. Army many chinese. They only call Abg to the transport operator. Abang2 drebar. Hihi

3,This vid was a banger fr  Shanise especially
4,"Nice episode, good to invite girls to get their opinions n perspectives"
5,"that line ""we will lead them to nowhere is true af hahaha"

7,do you guys ever think to make a merch?? if yes i will be the one who buying it

10,At last I can hear this minah speak proper English......awesome!!!
11,The warrior poster really bring back my old childhood sia
12,LOVE SHANISE!!! HIDUP MINAHSSSSSSSSSSSS!
13,"i feel the past few episodes are more like interview rather than podcast, you guys go straight into the written down points which is quite unentertaining as compared to more relaxed or a lengthy intro"
14,"18:43 ""haikel lemme talk aaaaaa"" HAHAHAHHA"
15,Like i said yet again guys Shanise the
16,"okay time to change my tinder profile bio... also, the man in orange sweater is very cute"

20,Aslem introvert
21,Shanise has toxic habits but lowkey seems like a matured person for her age
22,"Haikal : How would you ask in a positive way?
Aslem: Babe you okay? You want any drinks? that killed me brah 48:20"

33,lessgo
34,I think I know who Shanise dated at the last part
35,noce
36,I curious who Shanise dated haha....
37,"this topic i feel treads on dangerous grounds which thankfully managed to steer away from becoming a toxic debate. too many perspectives and approaches, boys and girls approach this differently, character also plays a part. introverts and extroverts and generation also plays a part. 

22:16-23:00... the risk is being led on to the point of no return where you end up having your emotions crumpled and you being a like a carpet stepped all over."
38,nice :)
39,nice episode. invite nice2 girls
40,i need Haikal to dm me on how he styles his hair sial
41,"Honestly this episode is a bit boring. The intro is too quick, like it’d be better if you can intro who is Shanise (altho most of us know her) & Josephine. Josephine is abit too introverted for a podcast."
42,any of these girls looking for fwb?? i am so down
43,Man it's been awhile since there was a long video and I'm loving this
44,"wah this episode really made me relate a lot and also made me reflect on how i live life. sham’s advice or just opening up about his life and how he became who he is, was really inspirational. looked up to him before on tiktok but never knew his backstory. will move forward with his advices in mind! :D"
45,"Love this episode , feeling inspired just from listening to what Shah has to say. Keep up the good work Wello."
46,never felt a 1 hour plus video not bored cause of how sham talks and his motivation
47,Great conversation! Respect
48,Sham is a great conversationalist but the interviewers should stop interrupting him. It’s painful to watch. It’s okay to be curious but learn to pause and ask questions at the right time.
49,Fuh  3.58am in malaysia rn. Aku patut ya tidur but terlayan podcast bai. Srsly nice work love your story sham. Love from malaysia
50,Respect to this man.
51,Eh Sia did not know it was 1 hour+ lmao honestly sham is my inspiration from going viral from during panda or is it grab idk to a business men owning his own clothing company than some more to a boxer from a negative solution cb damn.
52,Next UXM la! Dorang getting higher and higher yall should collab
53,"I thought Steven Lim vs Pradip Subramanian was the first, no?"
54,Best episode yet
55,This is my new favourite episode

111,its rlly surprising how similar sham and juff are…rlly proud of them both for overcoming what they went through…its true what they say that most of the time ur enemy are the ones that are the most similar to you…all the best to them both for the fight and may the better boxer win
112,I feel Juff has a very likeable personality. Nice person vibes. All the best for the fight bro
113,"the last segment was really like a big hug man :) thankyou mat for sharing your experience, really glad i spent 2 hours watching this episode"
114,"I'm looking forward for both Jufri & Sham to berdamai... whilst the world is coming to an end stop fighting guys...

& jujur dari tutur kata both of u in this interview both of u still have care & love of each other. U both may not know that ada yg sengaja nak laga² kan both of u..."
115,The anxiety part is seriously on point. Only those who go through it will know

120,@WELLOshow  terlampau suka sampai rasa macam nak mati
121,i think both of them (juffri and sham) kene datang balik dekat wello after the fight. just an opinion
122,"The last part is nice. My depression is the suffer in silence kind. And when it hits hard, I don't have anyone who reaches out and no one to reach out to.. Its just a vicious cycle."
123,Let’s go! #teamjuffri!
124,good episode!

139,apa description pmpn tu
140,Can consider subtitles for the malay speaking part my Gs
141,"mengarut sia juffri ni. kejap kata sham buat content sebijik sama dia, sekejap kata shah Iskandar cakap content sama, sekejap kata tak kisah sama tapi kata video template sebijik dia. Lepastu buat buat tanya Barber mana satu. Petik semua nama nak cakap org side dia. hahahahha"
142,"bro my heart felt words, you guys needs speak more english to cater to the general public man."
143,Because cd and police many malay. So they call Abang2. Army many chinese. They only call Abg to the transport operator. Abang2 drebar. Hihi
