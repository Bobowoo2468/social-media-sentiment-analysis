0,"Look for class not wealth, coz that’s harder to come by"
1,I’ve been training to be a househusband my whole life. I deserve it
2,I'll call her mommy
3,"I'm with this rich girl that doesn't show she is. 10 years and 2 kids later, she still doesn't show it. I'm kind of tired now, I just wish she would."
4,What?!!? Throw your ego out and eat! That’s my goal !!!!!!!
5,"Did you date to feel ego or to feel love. As long the partner is there & you both enjoy each other. As you given her what she wanted, a love one."
6,Even as a girl i. If he is higher than ne by a small or medium then np but if he is extremely rich that would make feel awkward
7,"It's irrelevant, doesn't matter who brings in the most money, as long as you are happy together"
8,perfecf
9,"I wouldn't feel comfortable not because I'm a man, but because of my character. I wouldn't want her to think I'm there 4 the money. I'd work hard..."
10,Bro if she’s rich that’s a W for me
11,why her voice sound very familiar. is she radio announcer?
12,"so what if the girl is way richer than you?? so what? if you truly love each other, money is nothing, there's NOTHING wrong"
13,Id pay for the places that i can afford and let her do her magic for the places that i cant 😂
14,It’s really a big gap and probably 2 different world. Love might conquer everything for start but ultimately that’s not enough ☹️
15,this conversation is so constructive makes me want more
16,I had this once but I didn’t know for a few months till I asked her if I could have some change and she gave me $200. I thought it was odd at first.
17,is this a Singaporean show?
18,@josh.goldstein I wish
19,Its tough man. I feel like ots even harder to please her at least financially. Like what gifts would she expect and other things...
20,"100%. Especially for guys who have self respect, they would defs feel the pressure"
21,"the thing is most fancy restaurants doesn't really worth the price, they're overpriced af"
22,"Just enjoy the moment, she is paying she is lonely she needs it, u like her she likes u"
23,To fellow low income childhood homies: I’m 👎 on generationally wealthy partners. So many quiet things about your core values creep up over time.
24,Id be like yes mommy take me out
25,true
26,"Look for the person, not the status"
27,I mean if they can help me land a better job with good chance to move up 🤷🏽‍♂️
28,house husband time 😈
29,Aiya tiam la Sonia
30,Say less😴
31,complex
32,"this only applies of the girl is more wealthy than the guy, because it's more acceptable that the guy makes more money in the relationship"
33,"Yeah it happened to me , I felt so guilty because I’m not that financially stable to afford such fancy dinner 🥺"
34,@b0doh scared the rich girl end up meet some rich guy same level as her then go for the same lvl guy know
35,Ooo the feeling of not being able to be good enough 😏
36,care about character and don't think too much into things. speak your mind when things bother you. simple. talk things out
37,It wouldn’t bother me but I’d ask her with u get board of me cuz your just paying all the time like it’s her doing all te surprised etc
38,I think if you set clear expectations about what you’re both comfortable with it becomes easier
39,I did . there was not much pressure . but the realty hits when you meet the dad. then wow.. u realise it's either you become a ms man or be yr own man
40,nah it wouldn’t change the relationship for me. i’d definitely love it and feel charmed. but i would also 100% feel uncomfortable with feeling spoiled
41,i actually don't mind😂
42,Nahhh if shes wealthy imma be the in home dad and support my wife all the way
43,Wait why does she have to be a tycoons daughter to be wealthy?
44,If it was me it must be suffocating i cant
45,What if the guy is extremely rich..will she feel pressured too??
46,"No, come visit me. Welcome."
47,it only changes the dynamic if the girl is rich
48,auto give up
49,Mommy?
50,that's mommy right there 🥰
51,"if she agreed to go out with you, it means fancy places are not hindrances"
52,RUNNIT UPPPPPPPP
53,I leave
54,Mummy 🛐🛐
55,Finna watch this rn
56,Within the next week I would be on my knee with a ring
57,Really loved the way this was asked and the constructive responses! Following on Spotify for moreeee
58,what if its vice versa
59,not really though
60,strike 4d
61,"what is the lady's name?
aww..i like the way she speaks. 🥰 and she l looks elegant."
62,The guilt 😪
63,I’d keep it real! And eat there once or twice and then next time we’re going to a place I can actually afford. 😏
64,"Definitely not for me, based on experience."
65,"I wouldn’t really care, just tell her you can’t afford it if you can’t and if she shouts try pay back it in different ways like flowers yk"
66,Dream girl 😂
67,"Please, I’m trying to be a passenger princess"
68,tell me you rich but don't 😂
69,"If she is flexing daddy’s money then meh, if its hers, then lets see."
70,very pressure
71,Can be girlfriend only not wife…
72,Similar for friendships too
73,Fam I’ll take advantage
74,Yes. I’m not gonan date a rich girl unless im rich too
75,This happened to me and I couldn’t help but feel inadequate. I felt like I couldn’t keep up with her and constantly playing catch up
76,skill issue tbh
77,Nope
78,“Tycoons daughter” not her money then
79,"nah man, she rich, she paying for dinner lmaoooo, she want me to do the housework too? ayo househusband time"
80,It’s a bonus
81,Nothing wrong with a girl that makes way more than I do and has the right Morales
82,Really it’s on her vibe
83,"Most important thing is to date someone you love, who has a big heart, that you trust and you feel you can have a relationship with."
84,Still in search of rich Lady
85,my first thought was “u want a house husband?”
86,"I’ve been a househusband apprentice for 16 years, I’m prepared to serve🫡"
87,real
88,"Financially feels small compared to her, impressing her family and tryong to win over her dad. Stress will eat me for lunch"
89,I’ve taken a big interest to this podcast
90,when wealth come I want to make my life better than before... but do not look down on people whether rich or poor because they have darkness side...
91,"Maybe take turns picking the place. Good food are everywhere, not limited to fancy places"
92,"Must be stressful, because if you're not used to a fancy life that's actually difficult to adapt to it."
93,I couldn’t find u on apple podcast
94,@nellislm idk man we seem q okay tgt
95,v rich girl please🥰👋🏻
96,the voice really asmr
97,"i think what you can’t provide financially, you make up for it in other ways. like in the bedroom👍🏾it’s only bad when you provide NOTHING."
98,"I had the same situation, it’s pretty stressing"
99,I can hear sonia chew’s voice the whole day
100,Well I would feel weird but happy 😊
101,@Anna oh
102,"If that happens to me, I'm willing to risk it all"
103,wouldnt work for me. idk why ppl want their partner to pay for stuff for me its uncomfortable
104,She’s beautiful
105,Both of you look so perfect with each other 🥰🥰🥰
106,"If you actually liked her and she was cool, try something she wouldn’t expect."
