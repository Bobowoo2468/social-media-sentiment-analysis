0,really interesting. from a european perspective this is quite shocking to me. my parents would never expect or even accept money from me.
1,"agree to certain extent. most parents provide more than the basic level of care, so as the child you have to reciprocate."
2,my parents once said that i am their biggest investment plan talk about emotional damage
3,"for those who has no parents, i'd give anything to have my parents alive. don't be so quick to throw away your parents."
4,some parent may not but some parent passed down the burden of taking care younger siblings to the older children
5,"tbh i kindda agree that our parents never gave up on us.. school isnt cheap, books isnt and food isnt.. they are aging and can no longer work do u"
6,"i think this mindset is quite common in asian countries, especially with older generations."
7,indeed. parents who treated their kids like investment or retirement plan usually the
8,"as a child of abused and neglect, i agree with her. parents can't expect when you don't do right by your kids,"
9,"as i grow older, i realise my parents are walking"
10,my parents are expecting me to pay all of my college tuition back to them for the next 20 years of my life
11,i think parents with a good relationship with the kids don't even have to ask. kids will automatically take care of them.
12,as a person should be grateful for all the love and good things happen to you.
13,"in most cases, parents chose to have us, we didn't choose to be born lol"
14,"nigerian parents are on this table, when i told my friend i didn't want kids, he said who will look after you when you are old"
15,be the type of parent that your child will want to take care of when you're older.
16,"@tiredboiboi very interesting comments here. i think even though they gave us traumas, the more we should give them $$ even if it's little. it shows how much of a forgiving and bigger person u are. but thats only if u are strong enough to have that mindset."
17,you own them your life .
18,"told my mum i'm not gonna take care of her when she's old and not visit her. i can do that if i loved her, but it's not my job as her child"
19,"if you expect your parents to give the best, why you want them to not expect anything from you."
20,my uncle once said to me that he is helping me with paying for studying so i can help him in future...i mean i should be thankful but is it how it's working?
21,i've been told this by my mom since i was 5
22,"this system worked better when the wife's was at home and the husband's worked, you can still take care of them but it's so much more difficult"
23,not sure if it's an asian thing but most parents treats their children as roi
24,this year my mom ask me about money 5x every month and each time = 1h. once when aunt come over she said she ask me food but she didn't give me money.
25,i think a lot of parents realize that having kids sucks and they need to give it a purpose. i don't think parents would really want a caregiver role
26,so what about sincere love
27,we as parents need to be in our children's lives and if we do good they won't let us be alone
28,"my dad screamed at my brother that he gives him everything and my brother still doesn't listen to him, so i said 'you give him everything physically,"
29,this is the african culture and it keeps the family together and in check in my opinion. we grew up bring insulted and bullied by our parents
30,tell that to our african parents lyk we end up growing with a mentality that after we owe them.. but like in a good way eg..
31,"it's heartbreaking, but we also didn't ask to be here. and even so, many parents have disrespected, belittled, and traumatized their children. at that point, they've eliminated the option of being entitled to care later."
32,"she's right when she says that, we as kids to our parents, don't owe our parents anything. they mistreat you? when you're older you do not have to 1/2"
33,older parents like my parents thinks like the first person said. but we think like the 2nd person said lol.
34,"my mother needs to hear this, she thinks i owe her the world because she decided to give birth to me"
35,"wat u talking...like pap mah, gst bonus u now, but after tat u better be filial n pay back"
36,my mom said a fortune teller told her she would live off the fruits of her eldest son. i'm the only son.. lol
37,@denimjacquet @pluv0n faxx
38,@li4 :3 literally our parents
39,telling this every morning to my cats. i let them to sleep most of the day and go to toilet with me!
40,"honestly this. my parents never really paid attention to me as a child but now that i'm a working adult, they are trying everything to get me."
41,@hillarynnn1 good vid
42,"@y u h @ @<3 @worm :) ""your parents didn't you leave you when you were young so don't leave them when you're old"" did i ask to be born????"
43,"at this point i feel like cutting them off tbh. my parents have said exactly they want allowances every month, they want me to buy them a house etc"
44,dont let parents influence your decisions
45,"it seems that those parents who think you ""owe them "" are the ones who deserve it less than others"
46,"in my case, my mother did leave me when i was a child. if she came back in my life expecting me to care for her, i would feel very hurt"
47,happy my parents don't think that way
48,"correct they never owed the parents anything , so i think after 18 years old..they should be independently financial and do not expect a single cents"
49,i will support my parents but i am also preparing for my old age so my kids will not have to be obligated to me.
50,there is risks in every investment if their looking at us as a retirement plan
51,three girls and not once have i thought about them having to look after me when i am old (hopefully i get old). a retirement home will be just fine so they won't even have to worry about me but can visit on occasion.
52,"i will break this for my son. i hate the pressure that comes from this. my parents are great, love them alot but they do have abit of this mindset."
53,my father literally called me his investment plan
54,this is why i won't have kids. i dont have good examples and also... my parents are like kids that i have to care for
55,literally my mum
56,can't wait to ghost my mom and her acting all suprised. this is 1000% true.
57,@kehan_h literally my family the whole reason behind having sehaj
58,if you tell me to do it i won't.
59,my kids are my only hope for retirement
60,would never give parents a single cent & they know + accept it - a deep subconscious within them that they knew they weren't good parents anyway
61,she nailed it! you can't be an absent parent and expect your children to be present
62,i told both my parents to their face that i am not taking care of them when they are old
63,guilt trips only break the relationship. i give my dad money every month but speak to him once a year. truth.
64,"true, my kids don't owe me anything, they're not made to be my minions."
65,"honestly, lets bffr"
66,"my mom always tell me ""y do u think i gave birth to u for"" when ever i tell her that she can't be forcing me to do stuff"
67,"i've offered my parents to help with bills this year. my mom never accepts ""cow doesn't drink from its calf"". interesting how different people are."
68,i think that raising kids the right way with love and passion it won't even be a matter of discussion it'll just happen not bcuz y owe them or anything but bcuz you love them unconditionally
69,i have been waiting for this .. my mother loves to throw it in my face and gaslight me like that all the damn time
70,"in fact if you raised them well and took care of them , your children will always want to take care of you when u old"
71,the more you tell me that i have to do something the less i want to actually do it
72,omg thank you sm for this
73,not all parents. it's definitely a cultural thing.
74,i would only do it if i have the means and they were a good parent.
75,this is so true !!!!
76,"i feel obligated to take care of then since their golden child and favorite can't step up and support them as they get older, i'm just the backup plan"
77,african parents too
78,i can't even take care of my self. how would i take care of my parents???
79,y'all look so serious
80,my family left me the legacy of abuse so i left them
81,that's why i ask my parents to give birth to 10 kids. so one or two of them must be filial
82,our parents need to see this lol
83,old people get dimenta become disabled incontinent also can become violent they can't always have adult children looking after them
84,good parent will give everything.
85,"when i first heard of parents like these, it shocked me. my mom always says that she'd rather die than have someone take care of her."
86,ima leave her with her gma like she did me
87,my husband and i will take care of our own retirement and help our kids build their family life where we can.
88,"i think is not even about parent/children relationship, our human nature just sides which is better for themselves"
89,its more like the other way around
90,whether retirement plan or not...am taking care of them. there is no other relation as pure as with my parents
91,my parents told me that i am the second parent to my siblings like i'm the 2nd mother and i was kid at that time
92,if your a good parent they're most likely going to take care of you but trying to manipulate them into doing what you want is not gonna help you
93,or some parents view their kids as an extension of themselves...
94,this is also a generation gap problem. no amount of talking and explaining will help them understand
95,i pass my mum the price of my bto and told her i don't have the financial capacity to support her and she agrees.
96,to the one in the middle !
97,say these to my parents and they'll throw a fit lol
98,if my mom wants someone to take care of her she should ask one of the five she didn't severely neglect
99,how to tell my mom this without me planning for my funeral
100,"because after ur son in adults in asian countries they put house responsibility on the son
then the son is bringing money to the house"
101,thank you! exactly why i can't stand my parents...
102,that's the main reason my mom had me
103,my mom and it's sad. i love her but it www selfish given the fact i grew up with an abusive father my respect goes down
104,my childhood was stolen and i'm still highly traumatised. they're getting nothing
105,that's my mum
106,this is so interesting!! i loved hearing all of your thoughts!
107,"i think i assumed my parents thought this. but lately, i realized they can take care of themselves what they really want is 100+ failsafes for me"
108,its normal in my culture samoan
109,truest
110,"my mom said that she expected me to take care of her, and i told her i expected her to take care of me and look where that went"
111,i love this middle girl
112,@live laugh love kokomi @bubblepopsick no cz my ma will expect to me to pay for her to go to mecca and buy her a lot of things and send her money
113,my parents fully expect to live in an in laws suite or detached unit in my backyard when they're old instead of going to a retirement home
114,i'm glad my parents don't have this expectation for me or my siblings. but they do remind us that they would appreciate it if we do support them
115,"if you raise your kids right , why would they not want to take care of you when you're older"
116,all my parents gave me was trauma. you mean i should reciprocate and give them what they gave me?
117,i'm finally on the right side of tiktok
118,well said
119,this tho!!!!
120,"i just talk to my belgian hubby about it.it was like that before but thanks to pension,it is a bonus that the kids visit their parents"
121,"""well, i fully expect to be reimbursed for the 20+ years of time, money & ofc love!"" my baby girl smiles at me. ""ahh, forget it, here's your pony."""
122,well said
123,wow this is eye opening and explains alot that i've seen in south east asia
124,@nvrmnd lol
125,"the world media control their mind, you parents better be careful."
126,yep. and then when we don't want to have kids they get very upset lol
127,100% right
128,i love how they're sharing their each view points so respectfully
129,"""your parents never leave you when you're young, don't leave them when they're old"", but that kid now also have kid"
130,"the thing is. no matter how much you know you don't owe them anything, it's very difficult to work on the guilt. the guilt of prioritizing yourself."
131,yeb that's my parents
132,a is absolutely right. listen
133,i thought it's only in the ph.
134,straight facts
135,how do i send this to my parents without sending this to my parents :'d
136,and they asked why i don't want to have kids
137,i remember my mother telling me that she is my responsibility
138,how to send this to my parent without directly send it to them
139,"this happens a lot in asian countries. my mom told my sister to get married faster until she old, and bear her own kids."
140,"noooo... my parents just said that ""you guys have to support me"""
141,ironic because one of my parents had just nagged and brainwashed us about this.
142,all brown parents need to see this
143,lmao may dad told me he cant rely on my :)
144,so true
145,"in reality deep down people always expect something from someone to do or not to do all the time ,that's why we hurts n painful with relationships"
146,yesyesyesyesyes
147,ayo in in the pacific also
148,i'm south africa we call that blacktax. where parents feel entitled to be taken care of.
149,yes!
150,@germaine i thought the first part was a given.. like uk??
151,my bro literally got hit 1000000x just because he played video games for an hour
152,"my mom gave all her money to my younger brother but told me when she gets older, i will have to be responsible for her"
153,my parents did what they could but i was not the favorite child and felt alone/without support growing up. so they can get cared for by the favorites
154,love this
155,one thousand percent
156,i wish i can send this to my parents rn
157,i really like what the middle girl said at the end i feel like people don't say this enough in conversations like this thank you
158,@val so real
159,so any of them have kids?
160,my parents had me to save their marriage now they are divorced and i'm living with my aunt....
161,@rema's gf my parents think i'm gonna pay their mortgage
162,my mum sounds exactly like this
163,my father says this but doesnt specify its money vise lol
164,"when i did a summer internship i made 1.3k my dad forced me to give him some of that money. he said i ""owed it too him as his daughter"""
165,no because my mom always tells me i need to have kids so she can become a grandma
166,well i think they feel entitled/proud if they raise a child well because not all can afford to be independent when there are old
167,my selfish reason to have kids would be i want to have some to love and i know who love me back and to raise just the way i wanted to be raised.
168,my parents
169,yeah
170,"""you can't expect what you didn't give out to your kids"""
171,the middle girl i love her she is my voice me love her
172,bro my parents expect me to take care of them when they are old until they die
173,in south africa it's literally even called black tax
174,yes.
175,a lot of parents had their kids with this in mind
176,it's so weird this idea of our parents i'm about to have a baby and i didn't make him so he can pay my bills when i'm old
177,when did i have to become the parent?
178,omg guyanese parents take one. i choose to be different.
179,yes! speaking facts only
180,my dad says this all the time
181,"heavy on ""you can't expect what you didn't give"""
182,"not mine, stay safe y'all. jokes aside, my parents saw their siblings made into my grandparents' retirement plan so they decided to break the cycle"
183,omg finally
184,maybe the old generation but i feel like today's generation raising their kids to be strong and independent i want my kid to be secure for for life
185,the fact that i dont even feel the love. i just feel the expectation to be her slave
186,not me playing this at full volume
187,i think my parents had me as a retirement plan...i didnt mind at all...took care of my late pops till his last breathe...and im doing d same for my mum
188,how you treat them is how they've loved you.
189,they try that to me but sike!
190,my mom threatened to sue me if i don't take care of her when she's older.
191,"if you dont know their retirement plan, you are the retirement plan"
192,i talked with my canadian friends about this and they were shocked
193,@deija y parents
194,agreed with azura!!!
195,i didn't ask to be here man

0,i'll call her mommy
1,i've been training to be a househusband my whole life. i deserve it
2,even as a girl i. if he is higher than ne by a small or medium then np but if he is extremely rich that would make feel awkward
3,"look for class not wealth, coz that's harder to come by"
4,what?!!? throw your ego out and eat! that's my goal !!!!!!!
5,"i'm with this rich girl that doesn't show she is. 10 years and 2 kids later, she still doesn't show it. i'm kind of tired now, i just wish she would."
6,"did you date to feel ego or to feel love. as long the partner is there & you both enjoy each other. as you given her what she wanted, a love one."
7,"so what if the girl is way richer than you?? so what? if you truly love each other, money is nothing, there's nothing wrong"
8,why her voice sound very familiar. is she radio announcer?
9,bro if she's rich that's a w for me
10,it's really a big gap and probably 2 different world. love might conquer everything for start but ultimately that's not enough
11,i had this once but i didn't know for a few months till i asked her if i could have some change and she gave me $200. i thought it was odd at first.
12,this conversation is so constructive makes me want more
13,is this a singaporean show?
14,@josh.goldstein i wish
15,id pay for the places that i can afford and let her do her magic for the places that i cant
16,"it's irrelevant, doesn't matter who brings in the most money, as long as you are happy together"
17,i couldn't find u on apple podcast
18,"what is the lady's name?
aww..i like the way she speaks. and she l looks elegant."
19,i leave
20,care about character and don't think too much into things. speak your mind when things bother you. simple. talk things out
21,wait why does she have to be a tycoons daughter to be wealthy?
22,"i wouldn't feel comfortable not because i'm a man, but because of my character. i wouldn't want her to think i'm there 4 the money. i'd work hard..."
23,just drop the ego and see where it goes
24,@nellislm idk man we seem q okay tgt
25,"if she agreed to go out with you, it means fancy places are not hindrances"
26,house husband time
27,the voice really asmr
28,not really though
29,very pressure
30,strike 4d
31,real
32,nah it wouldn't change the relationship for me. i'd definitely love it and feel charmed. but i would also 100% feel uncomfortable with feeling spoiled
33,mummy
34,what if the guy is extremely rich..will she feel pressured too??
35,i did . there was not much pressure . but the realty hits when you meet the dad. then wow.. u realise it's either you become a ms man or be yr own man
36,"if she is flexing daddy's money then meh, if its hers, then lets see."
37,auto give up
38,nothing wrong with a girl that makes way more than i do and has the right morales
39,"nah man, she rich, she paying for dinner lmaoooo, she want me to do the housework too? ayo househusband time"
40,"this only applies of the girl is more wealthy than the guy, because it's more acceptable that the guy makes more money in the relationship"
41,dream girl
42,aiya tiam la sonia
43,"definitely not for me, based on experience."
44,mommy?
45,what if its vice versa
46,"""tycoons daughter"" not her money then"
47,questions are unnecessary since you can probably find a drama about this
48,similar for friendships too
49,still in search of rich lady
50,really it's on her vibe
51,nahhh if shes wealthy imma be the in home dad and support my wife all the way
52,can be girlfriend only not wife...
53,say less
54,when wealth come i want to make my life better than before... but do not look down on people whether rich or poor because they have darkness side...
55,i actually don't mind
56,nope
57,@b0doh scared the rich girl end up meet some rich guy same level as her then go for the same lvl guy know
58,the guilt
59,it's a bonus
60,i'd keep it real! and eat there once or twice and then next time we're going to a place i can actually afford.
61,v rich girl please
62,its tough man. i feel like ots even harder to please her at least financially. like what gifts would she expect and other things...
63,"i think what you can't provide financially, you make up for it in other ways. like in the bedroomit's only bad when you provide nothing."
64,really loved the way this was asked and the constructive responses! following on spotify for moreeee
65,"must be stressful, because if you're not used to a fancy life that's actually difficult to adapt to it."
66,"i've been a househusband apprentice for 16 years, i'm prepared to serve"
67,"look for the person, not the status"
68,i think if you set clear expectations about what you're both comfortable with it becomes easier
69,id be like yes mommy take me out
70,tell me you rich but don't
71,"yeah it happened to me , i felt so guilty because i'm not that financially stable to afford such fancy dinner"
72,i mean if they can help me land a better job with good chance to move up
73,that's mommy right there
74,if it was me it must be suffocating i cant
75,within the next week i would be on my knee with a ring
76,"100%. especially for guys who have self respect, they would defs feel the pressure"
77,runnit upppppppp
78,"please, i'm trying to be a passenger princess"
79,complex
80,ooo the feeling of not being able to be good enough
81,fam i'll take advantage
82,why should you care ? she was literally paying you like a boss and your task is to eat and chat
83,if both side chose each other then why would money pressure you???
84,"i mean if she's with you she's probably very willing to ""spoil"" you when you don't have that type of money. as long as she's happy with you as you"
85,"no, not me."
86,it wouldn't bother me but i'd ask her with u get board of me cuz your just paying all the time like it's her doing all te surprised etc
87,pay up!
88,skill issue tbh
89,true
90,i would call her mommy. i'll do whatever she wants.
91,"the thing is most fancy restaurants doesn't really worth the price, they're overpriced af"
92,ill make sure that tycoon daughter carry may child
93,if she didn't work for it ..it wont mean shit.
94,look if she's got good attitude. in my case she wasn't and she only cared abt fancy stuff and spoiled af. she ended up with some sports car guy tho.
95,"just enjoy the moment, she is paying she is lonely she needs it, u like her she likes u"
96,"cap! it changes nothing, she will also want gifts from you the small things go a long way. both parties just need to be real to each other."
97,perfecf
98,to fellow low income childhood homies: i'm on generationally wealthy partners. so many quiet things about your core values creep up over time.
99,"food is edible, ego is not."
100,"most important thing is to date someone you love, who has a big heart, that you trust and you feel you can have a relationship with."
101,"financially feels small compared to her, impressing her family and tryong to win over her dad. stress will eat me for lunch"
102,"maybe take turns picking the place. good food are everywhere, not limited to fancy places"
103,yes. i'm not gonan date a rich girl unless im rich too
104,this happened to me and i couldn't help but feel inadequate. i felt like i couldn't keep up with her and constantly playing catch up
105,it only changes the dynamic if the girl is rich
106,"no, come visit me. welcome."
107,finna watch this rn
108,i've taken a big interest to this podcast
109,"i wouldn't really care, just tell her you can't afford it if you can't and if she shouts try pay back it in different ways like flowers yk"
110,"i had the same situation, it's pretty stressing"
111,"my first thought was ""u want a house husband?"""
112,well i would feel weird but happy
113,i can hear sonia chew's voice the whole day
114,"if that happens to me, i'm willing to risk it all"

139,i cant find you on podcast
140,love the eyeliner!!!
141,her eyeliner looks sooo good
142,if a woman is richer than you. she will appreciate you being genuine and sincere than your wealth or lack there of
143,give it to me
144,if u feel pressured u are not meant to be with her. being in a relationship is also knowing how to be mature about stuff.
145,she low-key has a nigerian accent
146,"if you can't support her financial, there a lot of other stuff she need i'm sure you can think of something"
147,it's outside your control. as long as she doesn't look down on you bc of it then no problem
148,she looks like hwasa
149,her views on things and morals should be the things to look out for
150,definitely... hmmm
151,"i think it's good to tell your partner about it. ask her about her opinion and how she'd like to go about it. don't be scared, she chose you"
152,"it feels weird when i more and more cant relate to ""not being rich""situations
jk"
153,thank you for the food

158,"that's why in islam we have to be ""sekufu"" meaning socially and financially at similar level coz all come with their own lifestyle. not a must"

174,why are people listening this db ass speaking

180,i dip see i'm a pussy and i can't handle it
181,"""she's rich... she's like a tycoon's daughter"" is it so much a stretch to think she earnt it?"
182,young people with their dynamics lol who freakin cares
183,"when guys pay, do girls feel pressured?"
184,"fk no, where ma mommy"
