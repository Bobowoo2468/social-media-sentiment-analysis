0,Doesnt china have this with their social credit score.
1,Some woke Star Trek wannabe BS here
2,This movie sounds like if social media decided all justice in the world
3,Good thing about all the dumb mistakes is that this is a comedy show. Like why wouldnt they just fabricate some medieval clothes before they go to the planet.
4,What is this Wakanda horseshit üòÇ
5,Apparently Ford still exist on other planets. Ford is a humanoid cannon event for all planetsüòÇ
6,"üò¢ man, even the recap became so boring very fast. Stopped mid way"

13,The god humper - Kelly.
14,"With shows like this, they are trying to attack the deity and divinity of Lord Jesus Christ. This movement is being led by the antichrist. But he will never succeed."
15,"In China they have the social points system. Someone who does something wrong is shown on a big screen and then can&#39;t use the bus or fly because they don&#39;t have enough points. To lose points, it&#39;s enough to talk to someone who has worse points than you and it takes years to get promoted again.<br><br>If you don&#39;t want that then you should get rid of the left wing idiots quickly"
16,"Only 10x gravity? Phfff, you earth fools are weak. I&#39;ll have you know that I&#39;ve trained under gravity hundreds, no THOUSANDS to that of the earth&#39;s. You are nothing compared to an elite warrior such as myself."
17,"I&#39;m glad I haven&#39;t seen this movie. Its just a Star Trek copy, but with worse story."
18,Sounds like Chinas Social Credit system
19,isaac went down there and fathered a whole infrastructure for a planet
20,"Such nonsense. A futuristic society can create a cargo cult but after staying a while, not a brief encounter."
21,Also known as having created &quot;Family Guy&quot; ü§£ü§£ü§£
22,10x higher gravity = crushes titanium which would need hundreds-thousands of times more strength
23,Travis Scott wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance on this planet lol

29,"This is ‚ÄúCancel Culture‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeing tried in a court of public opinion‚Äù, which is exactly how social media is manipulating us lately."
30,I see shorts like this and one of then said what is this then the human said its a cigarette and in the ship he said to spawn 500 cause its so yummyüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
31,&quot;And then they went to another planet... that was also like Earth&quot;<br>Crazy.
32,"OMG, Seth MacFarlane!!!"
33,"Fun fact:10x gravity is not enough to actually break your bones or crush you,humans can survive twice and half that"
34,This documentary on China&#39;s social credit system is great!
35,When voting is based on feelings everyone loses take joe biden as an example of this
36,Didnt know Seth made a Black Mirror episode
37,cant they just teleport him to spaceship?
38,So it&#39;s a shitty version of that Black Mirror episode?
39,I think we would more likely just pass out from the blood not pumping properly. Strain our heart and be hard to breath. I don‚Äôt think our bones would crush
40,Lamar kinda deserves the downvotes for that level of social cue cluelessness
41,And we‚Äôre supposed to feel bad for Lamar? You go to foreign place and before you even know the laws starts dancing on a statue thinking no one will be upset. What an idiot
42,"When earth is referred to as &quot;low gravity&quot; my inner scifi writer is screaaming. If the gravity on earth was much higher, we would not be able to send rockets into outer space."
43,"The series starts well,nice humour here and there, with a good storyline and dialogue. But as the series progresses, the humour fades and it just becomes another boring drama. Lost interest, never watched the third series."

50,movie name?
51,&quot;Travis Scott wouldn‚Äôt last on this planet.‚Äù  dude tosses shade like it&#39;s nothing
52,"Wouldn&#39;t a species from a dense gravity planet not only be stronger, but also be heavier, too?"
53,Honkai starails
54,so basicly twitter irl? yeah no i wouldent want to live in a society like this<br><br>edit: nvm  i just saw the medival planet
55,Surely that last planet will evolve extremely fast and get far more advanced than the rest of the galaxy
56,zargas 4 is reddit getting turned into a planet
57,So these are saiyan¬¥s? 10 gravity planet? Strongest warriors in the universe? üòÖ
58,i hope they continue this its so good
59,Black mirror.&quot; Nose Dive&quot; episode
60,Me like: OMG ICE CREAM STILL EXISTS???
61,They have spaceships but still have the electric chairüòÇ
62,the writing seem to be subpar in this series
63,&quot;yo wassup dude&quot;<br>&quot;ayyyy sup man&quot; <br>&quot;lets go to mars<br>&quot;sure dude lesgo&quot;
64,Lamar is so stupid
65,bruh that is space trek
66,Looks like EVE Online or smth
67,"Meanwhile, Democrats: &quot;We&#39;re running out of gravity!! We need to start using less of it!&quot;"
68,"This is such a good recap, your voice is also soothing."
69,Wow... So many ridiculous things.
70,The Orville is ridiculous but entertaining
71,It&#39;s how much gravity is pulling  them
72,"If you&#39;re on pc or laptop, press 1 3 4 6, all sound &quot;ur&quot; lol"
73,So literally the episode of Futurama but deadlier. Brannigan Begin Again.
74,That&#39;s the shittiest summary of a TV show I&#39;ve ever seen.
75,Kelly sees her own statue be like: oh f*ck.
76,"This is an entire Series, this is only one part of it guys"
77,isn&#39;t it star trek?
78,It&#39;s a TV series not movie.
79,Movie name: the orville
80,This movie is a chaos and mix of Star Trek and some other series.
81,Well ....Lamarr was a dickhead and ...guess he should be multi- corrected :))). What an idiot .
82,They screwed that alien planet up royally. In what way is it &quot;fixed&quot;?
83,"USS? Not very imaginative. Humans thruout history mistakenly assume that in future, tech changes but social, political systems stay same lol. <br><br>If u r in a future, where we are travelling across galaxies, be intellectually honest enough to show that united states doesnt exist. Preety much all countries/ geopolitical organizations wont exist. Concept of nation-states may be gone. Preety silly to show any ship named USS."
84,"ok 100% this isnt a real person talking right, it has to be AI because it fucks up a lot of the words and just continues to plow on, if its a real person kudos for just ignoring the mistakes lol if its an ai, damn AI do better lol"
85,"If Brazil were that way like sargas-4, oh boy, Lula would still be in Jail. And we would be free from that demon"
86,Reminds me of that one Black mirror episode
87,"I think i remember when this was a new show starting out. I thought it was like start trek or something. <br><br>On another note, i thought of how if you were being flattened by the gravity, even if they pick you up youd be crushed."
88,Haha omg
89,I didnt even notice seth macfarlane
90,Orville is a great successor for star trek
91,Lamar gave me secondhand embarrassment.
92,Is this Star Trek
93,"this isn‚Äôt because of the year that makes the gravity stronger but it just simply another planet, not earth. i know because i‚Äôm a huge fan of the orville series and i do really hope they release the 4th season"
94,A planet of Sayians...
95,"The Orville is such a great show, and it‚Äôs always cool to see a show you‚Äôve watched before"
96,basically reddit
97,"Sooooooooooooooo.........was that 11 Day Planet like brand new when they got there? Like, what era was it on like a month before they got there?"
98,"After watching all your other videos hearing this voice instantly makes me think something terrible is about to happen. But it turns out its just the Orville, and totally awesome sci fi show"
99,Seems like a cheap Star Trek clone. Yawn.
100,So they travelled to China
101,‚ÄúI guess Reddit made it into the future‚Äù LOL üòÇ
102,Hell naw imagine this planet has twitter
103,the orville crew find perfectly good planets and shenanigans ensue
104,The up vote and downvote system was a great representation of what social currency might be like in the future.
105,"damn, this video convinced me to actually give the show a chance. thanks"
106,I miss Alara so much.
107,Lamar is a freaking dummy . Lol why would he dance on a statue on an important mission in a planet that he doesn‚Äôt even know about üòÇ..
108,"On Zargas 4, Donald Trump doesn&#39;t become president because the reddit nation swarmed the delivery room and mass downvoted him the second he was born"
109,Seth MacFarlane and the room temperature IQ crew luck into bumping into a planet that‚Äôs still in the dark ages. Within a month the planet sees them as harmless idiots.
110,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=510"">8:30</a> this planet is full of absolute psychopaths they want to condemn him to death for 1 incident. Surely every celebrity would be murdered because 10 million votes would be nothing there would be constant targeted votes to try and eliminate people in reality a planet like this would fall apart in days with targeted attacks globally negative points would mean nothing as every leader and celebrity will have more than 10 million. I hate just how unrealistic this scenario is"
111,"Lamar and his actions are quite frankly pissing me off. <br>I&#39;ve never visited another country and imposed my own norms on the people there. That&#39;s like being a spray painter, going to North Korea and spray painting over Kim Jun Uns face, cause in California you just spray paint over everything. Like What???"
112,The planet orbit idea is soo good :D
113,Somehow the random badge gived to him is link to him even tho none of those badge are &quot;registered&quot; to him lol (random seller giving it to them) <br>I was expecting a crimanal doing something bad resulting in raising is downvotes ... Didint expect the raising of downvote caused by his little dance lol that hurt my brain as the whole story is around those badge xD
114,"To summarize, Jesus Christ was an alien on a slower time line."
115,tell us you&#39;re born in the late 2000s without telling us you&#39;re born in the late 2000s ^
116,They named a spaceship after a FNaF character?
117,"The photo on the face of this post is the walking dead, not a crushed body."
118,this is the kind of culture that the US is going to.
119,How would a suit protect anyone from gravity?
120,tbh I dont think U watched it
121,This was going to be stupid until I seen Seth McFarland. Lol shut up Meg
122,when reddit comes to real world
123,The Character Lamar is absurd.
124,so the 10x gravity point had aboslutley nothing to do with the plot of the movie
125,And i tought i could train like goku in higher gravity
126,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=574"">9:34</a> OOF that faceplant. poor rock.<br>allow me to introduce u two. Rock meet Face. Face, Rock."
127,travis scott lmfao bro
128,I never thought such a cool star trek ish TV show with comedy could be narrated and themed like a serious dramatic movie.
129,Of course they made a 90 pound woman the strongest üôÑ
130,the only thing about<br>THE ORVILLE series<br>that annoys me is<br>almost every race has<br>similar looking ships<br><br>they all look like<br>variations of<br>ROMULAN ships
131,but if you pay attention<br>the USS ORVILLE<br>is slower than a<br>STAR TREK runabout
132,Lol it turn into necron tomb world XD.
133,Redditors got a planet Jesus.
134,Apology video<br>Down vote upvote <br>Yup sound like social media
135,25th Century
136,Ending was silly and funnyüòÇ
137,Just another day in Planet Vegeta.
138,Lamar is an idiot and needs to never ever leave the ship again üôÑ
139,No need to tell us as we will not exist till then üò¢üò¢
140,Umm‚Ä¶people used to think the Earth was flat..that Earth was going to be destroyed by 2012..and yet‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
141,Every other movie‚Ä¶ Social Engineering.
142,Ridicuous premise
143,They are literally kryptonians
144,This show is great
145,&quot;Travis Scott wouldn&#39;t stand a chance on this planet&quot; OMG that caught me off guard.
146,Lamar is the dumbest character on this show. Do everyone a favor and drop him from the show.
147,"I love this show so much. For a show rated for 14+, I am shocked how many adult comments they can throw in this. It&#39;s hilarious, though, and shows the maturity that kids have nowadays."
148,&quot;Lt Lamarr&quot;<br>So that‚Äôs what happened to Lamarr after being sent in that rocket
149,"How do I stop these sloppy, poorly-written, badly auto-narrated, worthless videos appearing in my suggestions? What&#39;s the antithesis of &#39;subscribe&#39; for this shit?"
150,I love the part we‚Äôre they go to the planet that has 10x stronger gravity üòÇ
151,None of this would be possible in 10√ó gravity
152,Ohhh black mirror
153,Lol the 3rd earth in just 33 days managed to be as technological as orville
154,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=723"">12:03</a> This is how stupid people from centuries ago"
155,Meowmeowbeanz
156,It&#39;s too bad they ditched the humor in season 3. The humor was what made it great. I also didn&#39;t like the decision to make Issac betray them. He was easily my favorite character and even after his &quot;redemption&quot; he just wasnt the same.
157,"You missed that one<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=117"">1:57</a>"
158,"Reddit made it into the future üíÄ<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=110"">1:50</a>"
159,he deserves to be corrected...
160,why does it look like the people from the planet developed more advanced tech than those who come to the planet lol
161,If Twitter was a planet and its economy was reddit... worse place to live ever
162,And ( leap time)
163,The planet (skip time)
164,We can only get this far if there are no republicans
165,"So gravity is 10x stronger, but human beings born there look just the same?<br><br>Right................."
166,Isn&#39;t this star trek or
167,"humans will survive, the human body will adapt to nature, as well as the planet&#39;s  gravity where humans live. but if gravity becomes 10x more compared to now, and that happens tomorrow, then you are right humans will be destroyed, but not if it happens slowly and in the next 400 years gravity will become 10x more than today"
168,This is a great example of how political parties use the internet.  Propaganda is a very powerful tool.  How needs facts right?
169,Is this a Star trek parody?!
170,Would love to live in a ultra futuristic world
171,"And in like Season 3 those same time diluted aliens fucks with them but they had a reason to. Of course the guys in the Orville were not happy but they did kinda forgave them cause they did set them on that path. Nobody died, just a scared and pissed off crew."
172,@@raidthefridge7837 <br>ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£.......
173,"If ever we get invaded by a race of beings, living at that amount of gravity........ <br>We are F..... d..."
174,"She is built like a twig, no species adapted to high gravity would look like a white girls&#39; self insert powertrip."
175,"I wonder how much they paid him, cause I wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
176,Hacking into the voter data base?   Hmmm . must be Democrats.
177,This doesn&#39;t make sense. Higher gravity should mean less bone density as to compensate for the effect of your bones becoming too heavy to carry themselves.
178,Lamar got what he had comin.
179,.
180,Man I love The Orville.
181,"I would love the 24/7 hardcore training from the heavy planet if I wouldn&#39;t weight 800kg, a 3x - 5x planet would be enough<br><br>Also democratic social credits, now that&#39;s an idea for the CCP to try out"
182,10x stronger gavity?u&#39;ll be super saiyan in no time...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
183,Season and episode?
184,Jesus has died for our sins
185,this show has potential cept seth keeps sleeping with all the female leads... breaking up with them and then they leave lol
186,Black Mirror did it better üòÇ
187,Robot bullies humans by turning a garbage society into utopia.
188,That celly story is equal to hindus who worship even cows and kill humans
189,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=77"">1:17</a> wait what? THIS GUY?????"
190,I hope this is our ending üò≠üò≠
191,Alara was a good character. too bad she moved on out of the series.
192,"girl, we ain&#39;t makin it to 2418"
193,"Alara  was a cool character, but when she and Seth broke up in real life it must have had something to do with her character leaving because it happened right after the breakup. I guess I wouldn&#39;t want to work with my ex either. Who would really. This show is way underrated especially that first season."
194,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=88"">1:28</a> if you dont know thats seth mcfarlane he invented family guy and voices peter griffin , quagmire etc"
195,This is not a joke and someday   it will happen but the problem is not the gravity but the heat from the sun. .the heat from the sun will burn everything. .
196,This is not a joke and someday   it will happen but the problem is not the gravity but the heat from the sun. .the heat from the sun will burn everything. .
197,Reddit
198,No body is ever gonna see the world 2100 even
199,"There is only one way to explain why giant animals once existed yet do not, and could not exist now, gravity has increased. Yes, that&#39;s the answer. Gravity will increase again, it doesn&#39;t do it slowly but in sudden huge steps."
200,Peter Griffin is the captain of a spaceship? Wow! Hehehehehehehe....
201,Bruh how could he just die because of dancing
202,The problem for Lamar is that I would have downvoted him too. He was a total obnoxious jerk.
203,"damn, saiyans irl"
204,Why did auto play get me here? üò¥
205,All 5 people on board the submersible:
206,bro this is star treak
207,And I thought there was no tictok hell
208,They built their religion on something a lil kids said ü§î
209,Redditors Paradise
210,Yawn
211,"&quot;Its looks just like Earth&quot; - yeah, to save costs on sets. In almost every sci-fi series (stargate, firefly) almost all planets is &quot;just like Earth&quot;. Also, this  multiphase planet greatly surpassed Earth developement in the end of story. Just imagine that they would see when it reappears again!<br>However, space exploration isnt posible to this planet, since its constantly &quot;jumps&quot; to 700 years in future."
212,"Fun fact - human staying on orbit quickly lose their bone mass and muscules due to low gravity. So, this high gravity superstrong girl will be much less strong in no time on this ship."
213,This a movie about cancel culture and mob culture lol nice
214,so he basically ripped off nosedive from black mirror lol
215,Interstellar when????????
216,planet: &quot;gravity crushed humans with their own weight&quot;<br>fat activism: &quot;this whole planet is fatphobic&quot;
217,So this is why the quality of family guy deteriorated rapidly.
218,This is very similar to Chinese social credit system except that all the punishment is carried out by a bunch of brain damaged government control freaks!
219,"Lol titanium is like 100x less compressible than water, crushing a block to half the size means her hands are roughly 5,000,000 times stronger than atmospheric pressure (which is already much stronger than humans, not sure by how much), not 10x"
220,Lamarr was truly out of line and endangered his life and the lives of his squad. He should have known better than to do anything peculiar when visiting a culture they know little about.
221,The lighter gravity is could end all life if we could drop gravity as low as .01 g then all life end instantly
222,They already have anti-gravity though
223,What‚Äôs lysellas @?
224,Aren&#39;t the story ideas from black mirror? The writers just changed minor stuff
225,"I would love do live in this world, im weiting for future"
226,Its important to note that that is almost exactly not how gravity works.<br><br>Like... none of that.
227,Star strek
228,"Hell nah, they made Twitter a planetüíÄ"
229,you really gotta work on that accent with your &quot;sory&quot; ;)
230,Orwellian Society also called MOB RULE
231,oh hellg nah reddit planet üò≠üò≠
232,This is star trek
233,"Great recap, one question: cant you just upvote yourself infinitly?"
234,So some of the ideas Black Mirror‚Äôs Nosedive got the inspiration from this show?
235,"Errrrm, black mirror anyone?"
236,"Must be strange when the Captain&#39;s voice sounds like Peter Griffin from Family guy, LOLüòÇü§£üòÉ"
237,"Lamar is such a dickhead character, rightly voted for correction"
238,&quot;I guess Reddit made it to the future.. &quot; had me dying üòÇüòÇ
239,This is not to far off from China&#39;s current social credit system....
240,fucking twitter
241,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=246"">4:06</a> Lysella is so cute and hot üòê"
242,Gravity is 10x stronger and humans are crushed.<br>Sayains: &quot;Pathetic.&quot;
243,Reddit the movie
244,"Saiyans, Hold our beer"
245,too bad johny somalia never watched this movie before he made a fool of himself during his visit to Japan..<br>Lamar really embodiment of what buffoonery could lead you into...
246,you had one job Lamar
247,This summary is wayyyyy of
248,Zeliyan???
249,"pretty sure the girls with the up down buttons get tired of dudes pressing their up button all day, or do they put their buttons there deliberately just to get more votes?"
250,I&#39;m surprised that the voting system is actually used as intended and not abused. Lamar basically sealed his own fate with bad decisions one after the other instead of just keeping to himself. and not giving up the seat to a pregnant woman? seriously? might not be worth deleting all of your memories for but what the fuck man
251,"Kelly&#39;s not a God, but a Goddess!! üíÖ"
252,Saiyins would laugh at this
253,How hard is it to do a proper apology speech Lamar? It‚Äôs like he wanted to be electrocuted.
254,What is the name of the movie?????
255,"&quot;in Year 42069, people ARE the Twitter&quot;"
256,The downvote system is insane stupid!
257,Ok I know the titles of these Recapped videos have always been a bit off but WHAT THE FUKK!
258,what if there was some people in space that just saw there planet disappear and never come back as they wonder for years until they die
259,So this is why this mofo was learning Chinese and kissing China&#39;s buttocks
260,Bro. You murdered all of this. I want to unfollow you now.
261,Lamar is a moron.
262,What if someone had 1 billion down votes.
263,woman
264,@@gsdtxz No that loser was a male. A typical male. ROTFLMAO!!!!
265,Males are so dumb. He see by the votes he is not funny. He keeps trying to be funny but he is not. He keeps losing votes. Still does not learn. Males do that. they laugh that obnoxious laugh and thinks that&#39;s funny... it&#39;s not.
266,"Ive watched the orville yall should actually watch the series, even if he explained some of the episodes. The show sometimes handle srs topics but can be funny at the same time."
267,Wow this is similiar to that one black mirror episode
268,"that&#39;s not how gravity works, 10g&#39;s will not break your bones or crush your organs, it will starve your brain of blood and you will pass out. Also, object&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be crushed instantly. Fighter pilot&#39;s experience 8 and 9 gs and one Pilot survived an experiment at 46.2 gs"
269,Lamar was an extra kinda of stupid on that planet

Become less active, also because tire of living with the drag down. Even if very excited to be with other people, have great plans with them, are still pulling oneself around. Takes alot of the joy and fizz out of life, makes a procrastinator out of, but don&#39;t really know what have to do, that procrastinating about. Just exist for the amount of greed involved in the system. Forced to live the truth about that, no matter how much deception."
296,"Such a genius take on social commentary can only be done by a genius comedian like Seth McFarlane. He highlighted both sides perfectly, how the left wing uses their wokeism to give rise to mobocracy, how the far right wing uses religion as a propaganda tool.

343,Ohhh this is a series. I was gonna say! It did seem long.
344,Just imagine going on vacation to another planet. That‚Äôs just wild! This actually looks like a decent sci-fi. It must‚Äôve disappeared bc of a different dimension or reality

428,10x gravity mf this not the hyper bolic tine chamber
429,Yeesh and to think that the saiyans lived under 10x gravity for a living not to mention the low class saiyans üòÜ
430,The concept of celebrities wouldnt work in this world
431,Remember when this was about gravity-? Yeah- me neither.
432,"This isn&#39;t too farfetched as far as gravity is concerned; we humans already struggle with 1g, and especially so with 2g!<br>Social Credit going mad, notwithstanding."
433,Kelly is gorgeous and good making her a great choice of being a God. You don&#39;t have to be immortal just good. Think of what the proper leadership of a good person is capable of. Also a planet 10x the gravity of earth would have to be huge made of a proton number in atomic weight that it would resemble a sun. Jupiter has a gravity of somewhere in the middle around 2.5 as it&#39;s a thousand times bigger than the earth a 1/1000th the size of our sun.
434,couldn&#39;t you just keep hitting your own up vote
435,So cringy this guys commentary with the names of things in the show. Like Molloy being mistaken for Mallory like come on. Have u even seen the show or r u just reading q cards?

441,Nonsense all are from human work. Do u think u can challenge the Creators
442,would not the future be futuristic
443,Why I&#39;m having some &quot;The Giver&quot; vibes. Both societies are indeed dictatorial.

462,"Ah yes, Reddit the planet."
463,So from the movie all I got was the people lack discipline
464,"Only Seth has the power to make something so similar to Star Trek, yet feel so different at the same time."
465,Wait... this is part of the Startreck franchise?
466,I&#39;m so impressed nobody got mad at &quot;no  humping&quot; rule.<br>It isn&#39;t a felony.
467,What are you talking about? The 10x more gravity was in like 3 episodes later?
468,"StarTrek Copy kkkk In the series, has a episode that one plantet do this same kind of thing, disapear and return in days, but in the planet the people pass year and years"
469,I love issac it looks SO COOL cool robot
470,Is the Video Preview even in this series?<br>And if yes on which episode?
471,Wait a second!!!! Lamar will be corrected?... why the happy fun BLACK guy has to be the one to get corrected? Hmmm
472,"Sadly, the black character&#39;s actions are all too true to life."
473,10x gravity..<br>So we didn&#39;t become saiyans?<br>Lame
474,Your not wrong
475,If reddit was a movie:
476,I know they got the idea for this movie after a Futurama episode.
477,"It‚Äôs an episode of the TV Show ‚ÄòThe Orville‚Äô, not a movie.<br><br>It‚Äôs an awesome show with lots of hope and optimism for humanity‚Äôs future, unlike all the depressing Black Mirror BS we have to put up with normally in other shows."
478,Finally a space movie without anything bad happening

482,Lol
483,The future run by fruitcakes
484,Ah this is the movie where that weird headed guy tries smoking and he fell inlove with it.
485,L didn&#39;t need to be an a$$ in a strange place
486,How did they not invent memory eraser most racist people I&#39;ve seen
487,The Orville brought a fresh and insightful approach to a wide range of issues most writers can‚Äôt touch.
488,"I love how I saw one guy put it. Democracy is a system of the people, by the people, and for the people‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..but the people are stupid."

494,I mean these people were acting stupid for drawing attention to them by dancing with statues and the other is being dick heads I understand that you&#39;re not always obligated to give up your seat to someone else but these guys are officers and typically military are trained to be more decent at least they should be I know people would give up their seats for them because of their service but it just seems so strange you pick these people based on their skill sets and personality and the personality is some of these people I&#39;m just floored by
495,Seth McFarlanes wet dream.  Ha
496,This is planet Reddit. Everyone downvoting everything because they&#39;re entitled dicks.
497,They gave Seth McFarlane a role in such a cheezy movie... he he he.

533,Hilarious show
534,Literally the Orville is practically a parody/spoof of star trek and THIS is the thing you focus on about it? Huh?????
535,"Oh look, it&#39;s humanity&#39;s future, where the mob rules and the masses can destroy you just because they don&#39;t like your face."
536,Lamar was just stupid tbh

621,this looks like any VFX school final project
622,Sadly the newest season of the Orville isn&#39;t as good as the other 2.

653,"if the gravity is 10 times stronger, the people there should have 10 times less density to survive"
654,Infact 10X gravity reminds me about king kais world in dbz
655,Modern day Star Trek.
656,Damn...10x stronger gravity would make a 150 lb person into a 1500 lb person! No wonder they instantly collapse!<br>P.S. Gravity is a totally bogus theory. Research DENSITY.
657,Why do I think this is the future of humanity?
658,"No, it wouldn&#39;t. When a fighter jet pulls 10G it doesn&#39;t instantly get crushed either. It would take a MUCH greater gravity than that."
659,Would ten times gravity really instantly crush metal like that? I mean I realize you would ten times heavier but still?
660,Social rating nightmare
661,Wait. in the Democratic country you have no control as a citizen. The government controls everything including your money

686,that&#39;s planet vegeta right there
687,Worshipping Kelly was mostly half of this recap for the series.
688,I found this through full stop punctuation lmao

826,"My favorite part was when the alien said to the space creature, ‚ÄúMaybe if this was 500 times gravity you might have an advantage. But 10? I don&#39;t even feel it.‚Äù"
827,Sargas 4 is anything but a democracy. Imagine living in a world where Cancel Culture is the main theme. That is basically Sargas 4.
828,the reddit planet
829,You live in the future and are exposed to all different kinds planets and races but that is how you act when you go to one?  Is respect and diplomacy non-existent in the future?  I wouldn&#39;t act like that now even in my own country.
830,this sounds more like KRLD than democratic world but ok lol (the first planet)
831,Those badges are a great metaphors for the social credit system in China. Pray this doesn‚Äôt happen in the west
832,Goku and Vegeta would have no problem. Maybe a slight inconvenience at 500x gravity
833,I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt know this wasn‚Äôt Star Trek
834,Lamar or who ever must of been a part of this worlds little mermaid reboot. MAkes since for the 9million down votes.
835,The way this gets described both impresses and deeply disturbs me.
836,killing of the black man firs t. average racism movie. i will leave a bad comment .
837,Let&#39;s all just be honest Seth Farland just wanted to be the captain of Star Trek because that&#39;s exactly what this is a cheap knockoff version of Star Trek with poor acting the ships look like star trek and the outfits are just 100% almost identical to star trek
838,I&#39;m going to pass on this movie. Lol their friends got in trouble because they didn&#39;t give up their seat to a pregnant woman when clearly an open seat in front of them and my question is why is no one else on the bus in trouble just because they&#39;re sitting next to each other or because that she was standing next to them either way lazy director can&#39;t pick up on little details on stuff in my opinion the person that took a picture of them standing there not knowing about the pregnant woman but they noticed the pregnant woman they should be the ones in trouble just sitting there and taking a picture not doing anything about it just to rent somebody out goes to tell you no matter what in the future there&#39;s always a snake
839,Is it just me or does it sound like Isacc is  impersonating DATA.
840,"This feels awfully familiar, is this supposed to be like a modern day Star Trek with a different name same plot?"
841,Lamarr really doing nothing right here
842,If the gravity increase in the future..the gravity must be so low in past..that the people can levitate easily üòÇ
843,Still better than Star Trek Discovery or Picard.
844,"I don&#39;t know when this came out, but obviously this is more predictive programming material. The badges on everybody is like literally a social credit score that they are trying to implement now into the United States and possibly the world. Pretty scary shit."
845,Seth Mc is the best
846,Why not just rescue lamar?
847,Zargas-4 <br><br>Weird ass reddit page
848,"Exactly. I noticed that as soon as I started seeing the social credit score thing with the down votes. This is like literally what we are living in right now, or at least they are trying to implement it. Great reset."
849,Wow don&#39;t you people understand what&#39;s going on can y&#39;all not see how their programming and brainwashing you people into what&#39;s going to happen and what they&#39;re doing this is exactly the stuff that they&#39;re pushing today they&#39;re trying to make this stuff legal he just said a Democrat owned Earth that would be just like this just like they&#39;re saying this is what the Democrats are pushing they want go green which cannot happen the stuff that they were talking about it just didn&#39;t happen nature works its own process taking all the animals away that we can eat is not going to solve anything it&#39;s going to make everything worse they don&#39;t see the consequences they&#39;re going to have to go through their selfs it will backfire on them in the end time cuz we&#39;re in the end times and this is what they&#39;re showing you in these movies this is the social experiment system thing yeah they&#39;re trying to be like China and all these countries that are doing these ID things and scan in and chips in the hand and all this mark of the beast stuff they&#39;re getting everybody ready for the mark of the beast is what they&#39;re doing they will be doing this to the Christians we&#39;re going to be considered the minority to kill us off
850,"good job robot, the best result is always on the fine line between cosmic fuckup and perfect solution"
851,this is just awful
852,They should have just threatened global war with the planet
853,"Democratic lol... It&#39;s social credit system. Didn&#39;t know China was democracy üòÇ, idiot."
854,Lamarr is the Paul Logan of that world lol.
855,"What i learnt from this Movie : <br>Dmeocracy sucks, Religion sucks, A.I Robots FTW !!! üòÑ"
856,1.16 why is Peter Griffin in this üò≠
857,Really just have the black guy for a checklist and to be the ignorant ass char. At least I saw it on a recap and not watch the mid stereotypeü´†
858,Why you had to bring up Travis Scott ??
859,I&#39;m just glad one of these recap channels is finally adding the freaking name of the movie/show they&#39;re recapping
860,interesting story: can someone give me the link of movie please
861,Lamar annoyed me so much
862,"It&#39;s just the intro part where the gravity on a exoplanet with a civilization is higher that Earth.<br><br>Meaning planet Zelayan was a Super Earth, meaning it&#39;s massive compared to Earth."
863,really annoting jfc
864,"It&#39;s also a TV show, not a movie."
865,Fr
866,It‚Äôs not even a movie wtf
867,Fun Fact: Most of this movie has nothing to do with 10x the weight of gravity
868,Dude has to make sarcasm of Seth dont ya
869,and here we dont have enough air to breathe
870,Pls reelpy
871,What is name of series
872,Whats the name of this show ??
873,Honestly Lamar doesn&#39;t deserve to be saved
874,"This is such a stupid, retarded but interesting Idea of a movie. But I dont believe in gravity, it literally denys the law of density, volume, weight, etc. Cause how could you weigh something thats being pushed down on purpose also how can feathers float cause on a 10√óG planet the feather would never lift off!"
875,Is this the result of racism? or climate change?<br>I know it‚Äôs one of the two.
876,For a second I thought he said &quot;Captain CrackHead
877,&quot;hehehehe hey lois look im a god&quot;
878,I love this it&#39;s  both sci fi and adventure!
879,Aww this was her last episode üò¢ fun fact her and Seth dated and that‚Äôs why she left she says. But Seth is so great they‚Äôre still friends and when Dic married Issac she came to the wedding it was beautiful. This show is awesome been watching since episode 1 it‚Äôs a good time
880,You&#39;re a savage for that Travis Scott joke! LMAO!
881,Travy patty scott
882,"What&#39;s interesting is that in the book of revelations a person or being will raise itself above everything that is called God and deny that Jesus is Savior of the world.<br>It will do signs and wonders to deceive, many people will stop believing in Christ. Interesting similarities."
883,You&#39;d think beings from high gravity worlds would also have to wear pressure suits in low gravity to prevent the bends
884,Reminds me of how realigion works or see what happens in a Christian or realigion community if you do not do or bealive on what they bealive in you are shun and bullied.
885,You got me with Travis Scott ü§£üòÇ
886,Ms Perkins had to escape earth because she broke the rules of the continental.
887,Is it me only that thinks xeliyans are similar to saiyans. The whole 10x gravity and super strength
888,reddit the movie
889,"It would be difficult to achieve sky settlements without proper technology. The being would be forced to adapt to the planets conditions first before they could build up.. assuming they follow the humanoid traits. I imagine a planet like that wouldn‚Äôt have as many avian species due to the high gravity. It would be harder for them to elevate themselves.. plus winds may be more extreme on planets with high gravity.. making control of flight much more difficult. I think the author was accurate in regards to much stronger beings with high bone &amp; muscle density. I imagine other than that, they‚Äôd have stronger land mammals, ocean mammals, fish, reptiles.. you name it.. I also imagine a fair amount of flightless birds"
890,"@@zacharylortie2786 You are totally wrong and have it reversed. A high gravity planet that sustains life would have FAR more avian species than a low gravity because like I said, it&#39;s much, much easier to stay airborne in a high gravity planet than a lot gravity planet, provided the atmosphere is dense enough.<br><br>The reason why this is is because gravity works on gas molecules just like liquid and solid ones, so air on a high gravity planet would thus be much denser, allowing a much higher level of buoyancy for airborne species."
891,"@@Wasserkaktus Well I think the problem is that they would lack the bone density necessary to not be crushed under the pressure of the atmosphere.. that is unless they can evolve to have hollow bones that also are dense enough to withstand it.. which may be possible. I still notice on planets with high gravity, the winds tend to be much more violent.. which to me would translate in harder control of flight.. which I think would lead most species to evolve away from flight. Regardless of that, to develop sky settlements would take quite a lot of technology &amp; energy. It wouldn‚Äôt be achievable by primitive humanoids.. by the time they do get the technology and energy necessary to do so.. I assume they would‚Äôve already adapted to the planets conditions or went extinct if they couldn‚Äôt. I also would take a second to consider that a dense atmosphere is the bigger factor in flight for birds than high gravity is. I do agree that it would work in theory, but the avian creatures may be too heavy to take flight to do what they‚Äôd have to endure under the conditions of the high gravity. If human bones get crushed, it must be extreme. I won‚Äôt go as far to say you‚Äôre wrong, but I think the biology may not work in your theory.. I could be wrong though"
892,"@@zacharylortie2786 Who said that life would need bones? Don&#39;t arthropods fly and not have bones?<br><br>Hot air balloons would be MUCH better in a high gravity atmosphere, so why wouldn&#39;t you think that maybe life on a planet like that would just evolve some sort of air sac resembling a balloon for flight?<br><br>What I would think would be intense though is how ocean life could live on a high gravity planet, especially in the depths."
893,"@@zacharylortie2786 And with the air sac idea, why wouldn&#39;t you think sky settlements would just utilize those for air buoyancy? I&#39;m just saying, if sentient life/civilization would evolve on a high gravity planet, I would actually EXPECT it to have emerged from some sort of group of airborne species."
894,"In actual seriousness a high gravity planet with a dense atmosphere would probably see more &quot;sky settlements&quot; than anything else because flying and staying airborne is much, much easier in that environment than a low gravity, low density atmosphere. The REAL challenge though would be getting airborne again if you were to fall to the surface."

902,I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t around in that time lol
903,social credit in china
904,Do they go super Xelayaian?
905,This is also a black mirror episode lol
906,I think it is not possible life to evolve even one foot height if the gravity is such high at that planet.
907,Isn&#39;t the badged voting society concept stolen from an episode of Sliders?
908,How did Lamar ever get a position on a starship when he is such an idiot?
909,Forreal
910,This reminds me of Star Trek
911,Ain&#39;t  this like star trick from wish
912,I remember this episode of The Orville.
913,Commie&#39;s suck.
914,hmm human this planet trasport to 1 ton payload in this planet rocket size is same to N1-l3
915,cooollll
916,Even a super qualified well trained black guy is still a black guy according to Hollywood. He will arrive at an alien planet and wild out instantly.
917,Kinda crazy how they got Peter Griffin in live action tho
918,Social credit system...predictive programming anyone?
919,Just imagine the aliens are none other than such guys visiting earth frequently üòÇ

929,I miss Orville. Loved the series. Wat hed up to se2 I think
930,Your a bigot
931,Not even 10 people saw her healing someone and the whole planet suddenly started worshipping her without a question. <br>Hmmm I wonder where I have seen this before.
932,They stole that upvote down vote thing completely from early seasons of black mirror. Id sue them .
933,Cool
934,what movie is this

939,&quot;Travis Scott wouldn&#39;t stand a chance on this planet&quot; LMFAO
940,When the ship flys in space it reminds me of the movie predator
941,"So Seth pretty much ripped off Superman‚Äôs history. That‚Äôs how Superman can fly( jump), deflect bullets, and crush objects. Krypton had a much higher gravity compared to Earth. Hollywood truly has no more original ideas. They just pick them out of the trash, clean them up, change a few things, and claim it‚Äôs new."
942,its pronounced &#39; &quot;sa-lay-a&#39; the planet is is called &#39;Xelaya&#39; the speices are called &#39;xelayan&#39;

949,Please make your videos shorter!
950,Must have been a great movie dammit
951,O my Those pronunciations were awful üòÇ
952,Earth would have to be be 10x as massive to have 10x stronger gravity though.
953,"This reminds me off Corona , for not wearing a cloth"

960,"Kinda dumb the humans are the dominant species here again.<br>You would think if a race is stronger and lives on a planet with higher gravity, that they would be the rulers there, and in charge of most groups/companies/factions. Having the humans in the minority instead."
961,"Ironically, Seth McFarlane supported Bernie Sanders, who wanted to impose a socialist dictatorship on America -- one that would inevitably use a CCP-style social credit system as show in this dystopian episode. McFarlane, despite his intelligence and wit, is just another naive Leftist, a &quot;useful idiot of the revolution.&quot;"

1069,Lets face it. The Xelayans are only the strongest and Women because modern cinema and TV has an obsession with Mary&#39;s Sue&#39;s. Would be nice if they spent more time with decent scripts and characterization instead of pandering to a minority of the audience. The first season of Orville was funny and light hearted. But the following season turned into just more trash tv to appease WOKE.
1070,I think Goku can stand with this kinda gravity üòÇ
1071,There‚Äôs a political agenda at play in this movie. The ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù system is simply a social credit score that limits or opens the public‚Äôs access to everyday living. In other words communism and tyranny. This is the dystopian future being pushed on us today.
1072,If reddit made it into the future then humanity should‚Äôve been extinct.

1080,I think orville is taking from George Orwell..
1081,I‚Äôve been much watched all of the seasons of the Orville and including the final season when that moves on the season three but I would really be glad to see if they made a season four

Reminds me of an ep of DS9 where the Defiant crew is trying to find Sisko &amp; Bashir who...due to having the Orb of Time onboard iirc...were stuck in the past (Earth 2049). During 1 of the visits to a time to find them...Kira had to do similar. I think this might have been something of an Easter Egg reference?

1160,"This is why hard science fiction writers and fans always had such disdain for TV, which has audiences that are bad at science and critical thinking<br><br>What I thought was funny was that she appeared to be compressing the block of titanium ‚Äî reducing its volume. This is the kind of thing that nuclear weapons do using explosives (to reach criticality with a smaller mass), but we don&#39;t normally see it in real life"
1161,"All that because of 10x gravity?  That is the kind of stuff a human can survive with a pressure suit on his or her back, Even some fighter airplanes can withstand 9g for a few moments. So yes is a lot, but not so much and not enough to be manipulating solid blocks of titanium."

1204,lol the end was crazy
1205,"I like the Orville, but the show can be incredibly dumb in pursuit of its plots. A reasonably realistic crew would check the culture from orbit first, and at a minimum train the landing party to remain inconspicuous on the ground. Of course this particular plot couldn&#39;t happen, but a clever writer could come up with something else (perhaps the crew has to save a native in danger of downvote execution because said native is critical to the mission). Of course, given the Union&#39;s technological superiority, the solution is pretty obvious."

1308,And what I mean about that is like if you got something hot or cold where it expands and contracts gravity as such does that so if we are in one atmosphere and they&#39;re in a higher atmosphere it&#39;s kind of like if you took the weight off of a Kung Fu Fighters foot you may be able to move around but then you&#39;ll expand it before you explode like we would retract and explode
1309,Why tf there so many human inhabited planets but have different state of development?
1310,I think you got a kind of like a spectrum of gravity and it doesn&#39;t work like that but you&#39;re damn near close but you can go from one gravity to another depending on what planet and actually build up just like they can build down and get their self in trouble living on our planet
1311,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> Travis Scott  Would not stan a chance on this planet THAT had me dying lol!"

1326,Isn&#39;t this a black mirror plot?
1327,This is why you dont do stupid things while visiting different places and telling the authorities that you dont know the rules and regulation of the place is not a valid reason. Moral lesson: Dont be stupid.
1328,bootleg startrek
1329,me being obese<br><br>&quot;i&#39;m just ahead of time&quot;

1332,ooooh so good series ; The series available in which name please coz i what to watch it?????????????????????????????????
1333,there is a season 3 episode that explores the possibilities
1334,The planet at the end tho... What if it was left there for just one human year. Would they comeback as the most advanced Civilization to ever exist? Think of the possibilities
1335,Moral of the story: do not send Travis Scott to Sargas-4
1336,I usually don‚Äôt kind of like this genre but I‚Äôm actually interested oh my
1337,See now i worry what if Jesus was in Kelly&#39;s exact same situation but instead he just goes with it

1339,This is so blatantly ‚ÄúI wanted to make a historical show but the network wanted a sci-fi‚Äù
1340,I like this
1341,"Good synopsis, but it really had zilch to do with &quot;Gravity is 10x Stronger&quot;. Did that get more clicks than &quot;The Orville Can&#39;t Stop Violating the Prime Directive&quot;?"
1342,Bro the world of Reddit be like
1343,Is that a film
1344,Then how you know you havent know it

1348,Ayo my man Seth. I bet he went stewie mode to command the ship.
1349,only Goku can overcome this gravity! hahahaha
1350,Fun fact: if a person from a different planet with stroger planet gravity stayed at a planet with weaker gravity will became weaker if stayed too long
1351,Name of the series?
1352,Uo! This movie exactly shows what happened in India! <br><br>Kelly = Lord Shiva <br>Lingam = Space Ship<br>Jesus = the one who got killed in church

1357,"He&#39;s not just known for Family Guy. He also created American Dad, which is at least 10 times better, but The Orville is 100 times better than both combined. Season 3 is amazing."
1358,&quot;Travis Scott wouldn&#39;t stand a chance on this planet&quot;üíÄ
1359,I thought this was star trek
1360,Interesting how the primitive people were White &amp; the advanced people were black.
1361,You wont have damage in 10√ó gravity if seated properly... You will faint in seconds and die in like 2 minutes thoug. And yes a fall will be fatal.<br>Most humans can do is 7 to 9 G for short duration

1388,Yea i see how &quot;liberal&quot; this movie is
1389,No shit the logic is nonsense
1390,They logic is nonsense... People born in high gravity planet should b light weight n weak.... The dense their bones are the stronger the gravity will pull
1391,The sargas is basically the reddit planet lmao
1392,Yeah I started to watch the show thank you for pointing it out
1393,What series is this and the fact that this narrator jokes makes me die
1394,"That earlier clip (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw"">0:00</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=4"">0:04</a>) was not from The Orville. The real Orville clip started with the spaceships."
1395,"year 2481 and Statue Liberty still look like today?<br>in 400 years it will corroded beyond recognition and some of its part will fall apart, like the arms or the crown."
1396,i thought this was star trek
1397,Xelaya is the planet xelayan are the people
1398,Man I though I could train like Goku with that gravity
1399,Wait this is a show not a movie
1400,yo mama
1401,The entire planet is literally a Subreddit
1402,so this what the world would look like if redditors rule the world
1403,Peter quagmire Brian Stewie?!
1404,"wtf is this story,and why they need the strong girl and the high gravity for this bullshiy"

1425,I love your videos. I even watch all of your recaps video. Much love and respect to you mystery recapped. I hope you never stop because this is my life
1426,this is just planet twitter
1427,So this is a Star Trek knockoff...
1428,"First season had more potty humor. Third season (and end of second) had some real serious episodes with moral issues that Roddenberry might have done, if he were alive still."
1429,Once again the recap is way better than the actual show. I tried to watch this series when it was on and could not watch one full episode. Perhaps because being a Star Trek fan I subconsciously expected it to be like Star Trek. It wasn&#39;t and it was corny.
1430,Weird that the earth they have in this series feels similar with the Dr. Strange 2 movie lol. I guess the quality of the earth in DS2 is on par with TV series.
1431,It&#39;s actually better and more serious since Hulu took over
1432,LMAO Kelly became Allah
1433,Star Wars in a Nutshell:
1434,What is the name

1442,Him: the name of the planet is xelayan.<br>Me: excuse me? THE NAME OF THE PLANET IS CELEA.
1443,Great explanation my friend.
1444,This series The Orville is truly a spiritual successor to Star Trek TOS  and Star Trek  TNG!
1445,I SWEAR I watched this.. or started watching this.. but I don‚Äôt remember ANY of what you‚Äôve recapped here. Dang. What the hell?!
1446,"Ayo it&#39;s Peter, Stewie, Brian, and Quagmire<br><br><br><br><br><br>Also Ted"
1447,Can you recapped the byebyeman
1448,this would make easy subscribers
1449,So does this show do a plot copy of other sci fi shows all the time?<br><br>- A planet caught in a &quot;rapid time continuum&quot; and its future changed by visitors who see it happen in real time was done in Star Trek Voyager.<br>- A mandatory public voting system used in a democratic society was done in Black Mirror.
1450,Wait a minutes this looks a bit familiar
1451,So basically this episode is about how toxic woke cancel culture works on social media.
1452,&quot;He&#39;s also known for inventing Family Guy&quot;.... &quot; I guess reddit made it to the future&quot;...... I&#39;m sorry but those two lives have be in tears thus far so I had to comment!!!!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1453,"FYI, Gravity like many other &quot;theories&quot; has never been proven ... ever. To exist on Earth. Try density or buoyancy."
1454,I think I&#39;m gonna have to watch The Orville now.
1455,"If anyone is wondering the guys tie knot at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=310"">5:10</a> it is called elderage knot."

1457,"&quot;On further inspection, he find out that although the planet has returned after 11 years&quot; That was the best sentence of the video."

1473,is it a film inspired by Orwell&#39;s 1984?
1474,God Kelly is so Hot!
1475,"I think the rings on xelayan would cover a bit of the planet, which makes the shadowed part inhabitable because:<br>Assuming there are also animals on the planet, their internal navigations would likely be disrupted, but i doubt this if the planet has had that ring since a young age, and that the animals have already adapted to it,<br>The rings would also heavily affect photosynthesis and the oxygen supply<br><br>The shadowed parts by the ring covers so much that the temperatures on the shadowed part is near impossible to be habitable<br><br>But since the xelayan species is quite evolved has gotten used to these, then it wouldnt really be a problem for the xelayan species,<br>I dont know alot about the planet though, like the atmosphere and etc etc., i only know the gravity and its rings<br><br><b>honestly why tf did i comment this</b>"

1479,reddit in governmental process

1482,seth mcfarlane is a hack bro
1483,I was hoping someone else noticed this!!
1484,Yes
1485,This is similar to a Black Mirror episode called Nosedive where society uses a 5-star rating system that determines your social status.
1486,and that robot just rebuilt there thinking not fix the problem but just let them forget it she dying there will have fix most of the problem and made her into there son of god basically
1487,the fact she is still alive after how long there is for 11 day is for them then she is still alive then they can still let she be a goddess to them
1488,Why don‚Äôt they just send robots instead of humans like Isaac
1489,Is no one going to point out he mispronounced Malloy as Mallory?
1490,&quot;after 11 days&quot;<br>subtitles: 11 years
1491,Goku and vegeta somewhere laughing rn 10x gravity mehüòÇ
1492,"This is unrealistic.  Fighter pilots can experience 10 Gs for a couple seconds and the euthanasia coaster concept that is an execution method to kill people over those strong positive G Forces for a about a minute.  You would be unable to breath while weighting 10 times more as all the blood rushes to your feet very quickly making you loose concesness and eventually pass out and eventually die.  Stuff wouldn&#39;t instantly be crushed and brake like that, if parts of the suit broke, then maybe cause it&#39;s that 1 small area that&#39;s being crushed by 10 times earths gravity."

1521,"Electro-convulsive therapy has improved since the early days of its use. It&#39;s one of the few effective reserve treatments for when drug therapy fails.<br><br>Also, &quot;informed consent&quot; can be easily misunderstood by the general public. Mental patients in many Western countries are not required to consent (informed or otherwise) if they are under legal guardianship or court orders. The same goes for drug treatment for mental health.<br><br>However, if informed consent is denied (ie risks are not fully explained) to patients who have the ability to make their own decisions and pose no threat to themselves or others should they deny treatment, then that is certainly grounds for legal action.

1539,I love his recaps too what&#39;s good Caroline
1540,One thing I love about u is how u express ur views about movies when narrating them it makes me smile and I love ur voice

1547,I like this!

1560,"Lying down wouldn&#39;t break anything but a person probably couldn&#39;t even roll over, and would quickly have local tissue blood circulation problems just like when you sit down for too long without shifting. And the person who fell going outside a gravity field could easily have died. Center of mass falling from 1m high to 0.3m = energy from falling 7 meters or 21 feet on Earth. I liked the description of living in high gravity in Protector (1973), in that case 2.16 gravities. If you can squat on one leg and stand up, you could stand up in 2 gravities."
1561,"It makes no sense, imagine you lay flat on the ground and your leg breaks because is 10 times heavier. I can have 10 times the weight of my leg on my leg and I won&#39;t even feel it."
1562,From now on I&#39;m going to make all my problems on kelly lol

1607,The Orville is on Hulu and is worth watching all the way through. All of the characters get into different things but Bortus is my favorite. There are some hilarious things that happen in seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 is more serious but also has humor and is very beautiful in terms of CGI and scenery. I recommend it to anyone who loves scifi.

1662,"Also gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and as a planet becomes more massive, it&#39;s radius would be greater.  This is why Mars has 1/3 Earth surface gravity even though it&#39;s mass is only 11% that of Earth.  Indeed, the surface gravity of these high gravity super Earth&#39;s taps out at about 1.2 of Earth&#39;s surface gravity.  Now there is a possibility of the planet having more heavy elements and hence less radius for it&#39;s mass hence a higher surface gravity but that would not be much more than 1.2 surface gravity and would mean a lot more radioactive elements on the planet.  You simply can&#39;t get ten times Earth&#39;s gravity no matter how massive the terrestrial planet is, the highest you could do is 1.2 Earth&#39;s surface gravity."

1755,"Keep in mind that the more massive a planet is, the greater it&#39;s radius to it&#39;s surface and gravity is inversely proportional with the square of the distance to the center of mass, this is why Mars has about 1/3 Earth surface gravity even though Mars is only 10% the mass of Earth.  Even Jupiter is considered to have a &quot;surface&quot; gravity of about 1.2 Earth surface gravity and there are altitudes in it&#39;s atmosphere with both Earth gravity and the same atmospheric pressure as at Earth&#39;s sea level hence the concept of floating cities to colonize gas giants and planets like Venus (Jupiter would still have too much radiation to colonize with a floating city but we could colonize Saturn with such a city).   Such massive &quot;Super Earths&quot; would tap out at about 1.2 Earth surface gravity not ten times."
1756,@@johnwang9914 But it is impossible for the habitants of a super high gravity planet to live on Earth right? They should have a massive skeleton structure preventing them to move efficiently on earth.
1757,"@@snakeplissken1933 Why?  A super massive terrestrial planet would be of course a larger radius and hence the surface gravity would only be marginally more than that of Earth.  The difference between them living on Earth would be far less than the problems we would expect of living on Mars and certainly far less than the  problems of our astronauts on the ISS.  We can expect that a regular exercise regime and some medications would suffice for a &quot;heavy worlder&#39; to live on Earth with manageable deterioration of their physique and the consequence of not exorcising and or taking medications would mean a tough time recuperating once they do return to their planet.   We&#39;re only talking about maybe a 20% to 30% difference in surface gravity due to gravity being inversely proportional to the square if the distance and more massive planets having greater radius.   Now, this does not make &quot; super Earths&quot; good colonization targets as the gravity well itself would be much larger so launching a spacecraft from the surface of such a planet and leaving orbit would require a lot more energy then on Earth, these super Earths are planetary gravity traps for us."

If you like the show based off it&#39;s own episodes, thats one thing, but don&#39;t lie to yourself that&#39;s it&#39;s honoring anything but that dollar."
1772,"The rapid time plot also goes back to a 1960&#39;s Twilight Zone episode &quot;Wolf359&quot;.   However, many Star Trek fans sees the &quot;Orville&quot; to be more Star Trek than the current slate of Star Trek series in production (Discovery, and Picard)."
1773,"Some stories are interesting.  However, it still feels like a Star Trek knockoff in many ways, including the plots.  There was an episode in Star Trek voyager where a primitive planet had faster time than the rest of the universe.  Voyager‚Äôs onboard hologram doctor spent many years on the planet, while the ship in the orbit had watched the rapid development on the planet.  And the alien planet eventually become even more advanced than the Federation ship from the 24th century earth.  Near the end of the episode, the aliens sent two ships to meet Voyager, and one of them teleported himself onboard.   Tell me these plot arrangements are not near identical."

1819,"If you want to involve science, gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance and the more massive a planet is, the larger us it&#39;s radius.  This is why Mars has 1/3 Earth&#39;s surface gravity even though it only has 10% of the mass of Earth.  Note that given similar density, the mass would be proportional to the cube of the radius.   These massive Super Earths would tap out at 1.2 Earth&#39;s surface gravity not ten times.   As to the atmosphere being hotter, that would still be governed by how much heat the planet can radiate versus how much it receives, though we could estimate this again from the radius of the planet hence from it&#39;s mass, it&#39;s more greatly influenced by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, it&#39;s currents and the rotation of the planet around it&#39;s axis."
1820,Wouldn&#39;t there be increased atmospheric pressure because the air is heavier and therefore a hotter atmosphere
1821,Gotta make do with what you have lol
1822,It would be weirder if a planet only have one biome. Earth has a lot of biomes but most fictional planets seems to have only one biome
1823,and one even got a chevy cruze.
1824,Star Trek TOS planets all had rainbow caves.
1825,True or Australia backlands
1826,It&#39;s crazy how every planet looks like earth. Like how the old Dr. Who episodes are always set in a quarry

1846,@@theguythatgivesyouoneextra4134 LoL
1847,@@theguythatgivesyouoneextra4134 I agree
1848,I was pretty attracted to Alara. But thats most likely because shes the only person on the ship my age and I think the alien features she has from Xelaya make her look cute
1849,I forgot about this series. Quite a good one. I somehow (sort of) find myself attracted to Kylden when I watched it lol.
1850,People go paranoid just like looking at their iPhone&#39;s battery health going from 100% to 99% real quick lmao
1851,"Yeah, out of fictional planets I have seen this is the most disturbing, probably because of how barbaric and degenerative their society is"
1852,"the big ass elephant in the room issue is : in that world, the top of the society isnt those who has high moral, but rather those who is sociopathic and has been able to manipulated everyone&#39;s mind"
1853,whats the name
1854,"What I found disturbing is you can see some of the same trends happening now.  That society takes cancel culture to the extreme.  Some one is judged and persecuted for one perceived slight of the social norm, and the &quot;justice system&quot; is the court of public opinion where hurt feelings are more important than the fact that all he did was dance with a statue."
1855,the episode where the public determines whether they live or not stressed the shit out of me.
1856,I might believe they are that strong if thay came from the planet Samus from metroid grew up on. I think it has 5 to 10 thousand times the mass of earth.
1857,"Jupiter&#39;s surface gravity is over twice that of Earth, do you see Jupiter crashing into the Sun? No. 10 times isn&#39;t realistic for a planet, but it wouldn&#39;t matter for the orbit of the planet."

1875,And they shd be strong and advance like superman on zarkas planet but are weak as a antüòÇ
1876,They have camouflage tech but it apparently sucks and malfunctions alot. They used them once but it failed and they got screwed over...so they don&#39;t like using them again. Apparently that particular tech is just shotty
1877,"Yeah, but they needed it to happen so the plot could happen..."
1878,"It&#39;s season 1, they were still busy being a comedy dressed up like Star Trek instead of being more Star Trek than Disco or Picard."
1879,"On the whole Kelly situation, all of that would be avoided if they had some sort of camouflage. To think that they could heal a wound with a barcode reader, yet they don&#39;t have any camouflage tech."

1890,Ol
1891,150 comment cool
1892,I like how it&#39;s named &#39;USS&#39; Orville
1893,Just get better
1894,Nothing like a knockoff Star Trek with knockoff ferengi
1895,I watched 10+ videos once. <br>let‚Äôs say ummmmm<br>i couldn‚Äôt sleep at night with all the movies in my mind
1896,I watch 5 videos from Mystery Recapped and it&#39;s like I watch 5 movies in one day
1897,"Honestly I think a person like Lamar with so little situational awareness, should have his mind wiped, it would save the rest of the world a lot of issues if idiots were punished for being idiots."
1898,All I see is Stewie Griffin or Roger Smith
1899,This universe is fun
1900,It&#39;s amazing how many planets are out there that look just like earth and are somehow very similar to places where you can legally film on earth.
1901,whats the name

1906,Reddit is more popular in this timeline
1907,No different.
1908,Hey isn&#39;t this basically Star Trek
1909,That&#39;s the point. Seth loved Star Trek and hence wanted to come up with his version of it.
1910,"@@supahmariostyle Thanks for that, I dont know this video so only seen the recap, makes sense now :D"
1911,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehSr-HIKVMw&amp;t=56"">0:56</a> star trek much?"

1915,so basically zargas 4 is the twitter planet?
1916,My name is orvil
1917,Year 2022. overweigh people dies for the same reason with different illnesses.
1918,I truly believe The Orville is a better show than star trek. I mean the humouristic element is what really makes it stand out from other science fiction space travel movies/shows
1919,"The Orville is one of my favourite space movies of all time, up there with Star Trek. <br><br>By the way, I also do movie recaps on my channel if anyone is interested."

1921,:D
1922,Oh god twitter?
1923,"@@stonks9571 yup, if i remember correctly, that episode is called &quot;Mob Rules&quot;, every decision made on that planet is decided by their version of Twitter... if you get canceled on that planet, like the researcher, you&#39;ll get lobotomized.."
1924,@@zerocalvin im not gonna watch this now
1925,@@stonks9571 why not? The Orville is one of the best sci-fi series we have recently...
1926,@@zerocalvin wait i don&#39;t see your comment
1927,Alara returning to Xelayan is one of the saddest episode in the series... also Twitter Planet episode is really scary because we are kinda heading toward that path..

1940,@@andrewdock7288 my mistake I meant to say it was close to a Voyager episode with time speeding by on a planet. Are you familiar with that episode?
1941,I pretty close knock off of a Star Trek Voyager episode. The Voyager sent the hologram Doctor down because instead of this robot.
1942,"Red Dwarf: Who are you?<br>Orville: I&#39;m you, but on Fox"
1943,Great explanation
1944,Isaac&#39;s are always the smartest ones

1981,80
1982,"And Nosedive is basically identical to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Lots of works take inspiration from others and offer their spin. It&#39;s nothing new."

1984,This idea is basically identical to the Black Mirror episode &quot;Nosedive&quot;. Seth MacFarlane is pretty shameless for this one.
