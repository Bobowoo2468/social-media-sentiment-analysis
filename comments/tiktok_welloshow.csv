1,the 2 girls got ghosted after the podcast also
2,"""be more straightforward"" when they themselves aren't straightforward enough to tell a girl how it is instead they ghost bffr"
3,i was not expecting that
4,relatable bcs i don't think there's a way to run from awkwardness
5,""" ghost la , now dont know already "" hahahahahahahhaa"
6,ghost yes! if they re-appear again... leave them alone... respect the dead.
7,"nak girls jd straight forward, tp bila nak reject gi ghost pulak...
single never understand this"
8,the one ghosting always come back
9,"""now dont know already!"""
10,correct!
11,"based on experience, yes that's the best way. we just don't pretend"
12,hahahah now dont know alr but at least y'all get to reject girls
13,then why chasing us in the first place
14,"""now don't know already"" brooo"

49,"ghosting is a bit too over the edge, probably like reply but not make it fun i guess?"
50,people: ghosting is symbol of rejection. while me: ghosting is 'jual mahal' for me
