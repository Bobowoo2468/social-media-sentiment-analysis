"i'm more impressed at how perfect the sphere was, more than the fact that she crushed a titanium block"
fr like I couldn’t even do that with play doh when I was 5 
 @phi1688  
" @phi1688  Well, she is not 5 and everyone can make an almost perfect ball out of some material that is soft enough, like that doh you were playing with. But, it is obvious that it was done because Orville is not a really serious series."
yea it was perfect  ♡ I do recaps too if you're interested !
Mand blooowing
 @ozymandiasultor9480  no they can't. Even the most perfect sphere in the world is still far from perfect. People can make spheres.  That's all.
" @seiyuokamihimura5082  How perfect is perfect for you? You think whatever they used in that series was ""perfect""? And I never claimed that we can make whatever is perfect for you, just with our hands. 
The closest to perfect made by human beings are fused quartz gyroscopic rotors built for NASA's Gravity Probe B spacecraft.
In nature, the sun is close to a perfect sphere. Maybe neutron stars are even more perfect, then again, it depends on what you ask for. "
Lol same here

"It's true, I can't take him too seriously as an actor, I always see him as animator surrounded by zany characters."
"And he's actually reading the script, he doesn't have a bad-robot reading it!!"
5:50 i can't hahahahah
name of this movie pls
" @happymembers3761  it’s a TV series called “The Orville”. It’s got good sci-fi topics, but is funny too. This been running for 3 seasons, and has 36 episodes total. It was on Fox for 2 seasons, and it’s on Hulu now."
 @b0neme  thanks
When I read that it said he is also the guy yea
lets not get carried away. This is a serious topic
Fun Fact: Most of this movie has nothing to do with 10x the weight of gravity
"It's just the intro part where the gravity on a exoplanet with a civilization is higher that Earth.

Meaning planet Zelayan was a Super Earth, meaning it's massive compared to Earth."
really annoting jfc
"It's also a TV show, not a movie."
Fr
It’s not even a movie wtf
"Only Seth has the power to make something so similar to Star Trek, yet feel so different at the same time."
“Travis Scott wouldn’t last on this planet.” This had me laughing 
""
Came for this comment was hilarious 
""
He's an invertebrate

imagine EDP on this planet
YOSEMITE NEVER APPOLOGIZES
"Seth is a great writer, it's a shame the network won't let family guy die so he can focus on more creative works like this. He seems to enjoy working on American Dad and this show more anyway. You can tell by the writing."
"Seth doesn't write for family guy anymore, only does voices"
Talented yes he is. But I was sorely disappointed to find out he’s racist.
 @alakesargeant6636  how is he racist?
Being vulgar does not make you a genius it just makes you a lot of money and people believe you're a genius because of that this world is truly fucked
 @alakesargeant6636  you skipped sarcasm classes
" @0rangeberri547  if it were just being vulgar, then his shows wouldn't be any more popular than Pink Flamingos."
 @twistysnacks  you can have your opinion I just think he's disgusting and vulgar and as a writer she reaches for our lower selves he's doesn't take it any higher but that's my opinion you keep yours
The bigger pity is that Seth wanted to make a proper homage to Star Trek. A serious sci-fi show. But the money holders insisted that he had to make a sitcom! And then they insisted it had to be utterly WOKE.
 @MrRicehard  in other words he sold out for the bag
"My favorite part was when the alien said to the space creature, “Maybe if this was 500 times gravity you might have an advantage. But 10? I don't even feel it.”"
Vegita vs that stupid alien in the final arc of dbz?
 @petar932  yeah
"Welcome to the end of your life 
And i promise is gonna hurt"
Pui pui
Such an underrated show. Glad they're bringing it back.
Season 4 confirmed?
 @OneofInfinity.  I read an article they are continuing the series on Hulu. I hope they go through with it. You know how that can go though. I'm keeping hope alive that they will.
"I loved this show! The Orville was a great follow up to Star Trek in my opinion, it had the same spirit that TOS and TNG had, some of the other spinoffs kind of lost track of that along the way."
Voyager still has that
" @ufodeath  Voyager wasn't given as much love as I felt it deserved, I rather liked that one."
 @heatherwanderer777  you mean discovery ?
Love this show...season 3 is getting to be on a whole other level.
"IIRC this was Seth’s act of spite when they told him he couldn’t make a new Star Trek because “he wouldn’t take it seriously”/“his humour was too heavy for the tone”. Personally would have liked to see Star Trek leave the 60s, Voyager and Picard were both* alright but I still would’ve loved to see Seth’s take!!"
" @StoneCoolds  Discovery???
Certainly not!"
"On the whole Kelly situation, all of that would be avoided if they had some sort of camouflage. To think that they could heal a wound with a barcode reader, yet they don't have any camouflage tech."
Lmao barcode healer. Fr tho why don't they have camouflage tech?
And they shd be strong and advance like superman on zarkas planet but are weak as a ant
They have camouflage tech but it apparently sucks and malfunctions alot. They used them once but it failed and they got screwed over...so they don't like using them again. Apparently that particular tech is just shotty
"Yeah, but they needed it to happen so the plot could happen..."
"It's season 1, they were still busy being a comedy dressed up like Star Trek instead of being more Star Trek than Disco or Picard."
Cz
They have camouflage technology. Just that it's so good that people don't even know it exist.
Hi
John Cena needs to fix his camo tech then. Because I can see them. 
"I am so glad these recapped channels exist, so people can make informed viewing decisions, and that choosing not to a watch any given show, wasn't in vain."
"It's fairly realistic, because for I weigh 230lbs (112kg or something), at 10Gs, the weight I'd feel would be similar to having four Harley Davidson Street Glide motorcycles on my body simultaneously."
"Humans see this as dangerous, Vegeta sees this as light work training."
Facts
Vijeta and Gokul are on a completely different league all together
"Yeah, obviously these people just haven't done enough sit-ups, or drank the right juice."
Saiya Jin would make a joke of 10x gravity
Planet Vegeta itself is 10x earth gravity actually.
lol
"Way, way too few DBZ references in the comments."
I hear seth wanted to make this more serious like an actual star trek spiritual successor but was basically told that it wouldn't be greenlit if it wasn't made into a comedy.
Watch Season 3.
It's more serious now when Hulu took over
They have new episodes
 @blackrayal80  I'm really hoping Disney let's it keep going
Man I don't think public masturbation does well on this planet. I'd be gone in hours. Maybe a day.
Disney increased it's budget and made it darker. The humor was toned down but it's still there. Also RIP Norm MacDonald.
" @daeviant  ""Yeah sure I'll play a blob"" - Seth on how he got Norm to play Yaphit"
Finally a space movie without anything bad happening
"It’s an episode of the TV Show ‘The Orville’, not a movie.

It’s an awesome show with lots of hope and optimism for humanity’s future, unlike all the depressing Black Mirror BS we have to put up with normally in other shows."
"The Orvill is the Next Generation we didn't know we needed, great show!"
"""Hence, their best chance to escape a correction is to prepare a perfect public apology speech. Travis Scott won't stand a chance on this planet"" Ded is me"

 @nazmameah3810  JSJSSJSJSJ
Lmao
""
I just go to the comments and accidentally hear what your comment said
"""Ded is me"" is actually like a meme or a joke where I live in"
How did I miss this series? This is one of the series that should be watched instead of a summary. Noooooo..
"Go watch it now, this is just the summary of 2 episodes"
"Like many new tv series, it's behind a streaming pay wall like Hulu.  Recently, I believe it has moved to Disney+.   Basically you have to pay a monthly subscription to watch this show."
 @julius43461  haha very good
It’s sooo good honestly one of the best sci FI of the last 10 years I would dare say
" @BruceLeroyUK  Nice photos Mr T. I am getting into photography myself with Nikon D3400. What do you use? I love taking pictures of people, so I can totally see myself getting into sport photography."
It's on Disney+ now
" @julius43461   down votes? from who? the haters? 
194TB up loaded this year come at me bro! I've spent a couple months making sure a 70% utilization of my 1Gbps line just in upload. I should be uploading at 125... with over head, with downtime and with regular use, it has been 70Mbps average up. "
"First 2 seasons aired on Fox, so you might be able to see them without Hulu"
 @sasuke22dante  Do you know which episodes These ?
 @Sahret-Ellelah   7and 12 from season 1
I'm just glad one of these recap channels is finally adding the freaking name of the movie/show they're recapping
"This is such a good recap, your voice is also soothing."
"""Travis Scott won't stand a chance on this Planet"" "
It's crazy how every planet looks like earth. Like how the old Dr. Who episodes are always set in a quarry
Orville. One of if not the best Scifi series. I love it!
I just love the humor you insert in your videos. that's why you're my favorite movie recap channel
I would definitely take my suit off to be crushed to escape my financial situation
the episode where the public determines whether they live or not stressed the shit out of me.
"Alara left the show and I was so sad! She was just the biggest sweetheart, her imposter syndrome arc was so wholesome, Ed loved her so much and so did I ️"
The Orville brought a fresh and insightful approach to a wide range of issues most writers can’t touch.
Goku did 100x gravity training. The man's unstoppable.
"You are on a mission undercover on a planet.  The first thing Lamar does is dance hump a statue.  Hence, that drama part of the mission couldve been avoided"
Love it  Thank you !
"Is the Video Preview even in this series?
And if yes on which episode?"
This is similar to a Black Mirror episode called Nosedive where society uses a 5-star rating system that determines your social status.
"""On further inspection, he find out that although the planet has returned after 11 years"" That was the best sentence of the video."
The way this gets described both impresses and deeply disturbs me.
i hope they continue this its so good
OMG I didn’t know I needed this in my life. Please do as much of this series as you can! I love your recaps! 
That last planet will completely take over everything - every 11 days they come back with 7 additional centuries of research and development.
Seth is such a genius! This show is awesome 
1:42 CANADIAN 🇨🇦
I love the orville so this Channel making a video on it makes it even better
My man roasted Travis Scott with a one liner 
I love this it's  both sci fi and adventure!
This series The Orville is truly a spiritual successor to Star Trek TOS  and Star Trek  TNG!
I love your videos. I even watch all of your recaps video. Much love and respect to you mystery recapped. I hope you never stop because this is my life
This put me in the mind frame of Star Trek
"I love this show! I've rewatched the entries series about 4 times xD it's funny, heart-warming, thought provoking, just really good!"
Love youre commentary
Wow. I must have this series!
"Vegeta be like
 10 times gravity ? I can go over 500 times Earth gravity"
"""Travis Scott wouldn't stand a chance on this planet"" Best one yet"
Great show
This show is crazy good!
"Thanks for introducing this series!  I can't wait to watch it.

Source:  my personal experience and Google Scholar."
"1:33

Nice"
"This reminded me of Goku and Vegeta, as well as Gohans stand echoes act 3"
Love the recaps.. I think the only thing I learned from this is that even on other planets ppl like me still not getting fair treatment ️ God Humper 
10:05 the planet just went out of render distance
"The Orville, let’s take a moment to remember fellow Canadian Norm Macdonald the voice of Yaphet.
Lysella makes another appearance in Season 3 in a not-too-bad episode."
Aww this was her last episode  fun fact her and Seth dated and that’s why she left she says. But Seth is so great they’re still friends and when Dic married Issac she came to the wedding it was beautiful. This show is awesome been watching since episode 1 it’s a good time
"8:52 Sefilla: HOT upvote
bruh"
5:50 NAH THAT ONE GOT ME HARD LMFAO
Season and episode?
The planet orbit idea is soo good :D
You'd think beings from high gravity worlds would also have to wear pressure suits in low gravity to prevent the bends
8:50 he really said OMG that’s crazy
"The last planet would be awfully dangerous 11 days for you to prepare and 7 hundred years for them, not only that they also have two whole universe for materials to use, no matter what happen if i know there is a planet like that i will conquer it for my self or destroy it"
1:57 I swear I saw that stuff form another movie
I like how it's named 'USS' Orville
"""I guess Reddit made it to the future.. "" had me dying "
The places they travel feel almost like theyre traveling through light years instead of space
I forgot about this series. Quite a good one. I somehow (sort of) find myself attracted to Kylden when I watched it lol.
"OMG, you made The Orville sound like a serious show!"
"The Orville is such a great show, and it’s always cool to see a show you’ve watched before"
"I'm a huge sci-fi fan, but its reality that hard sci-fi puts most folks to sleep.  Thus, we have The Orville instead of The Three Body Problem."
You know Goku and The Boys will love that planet
He said “sorry” the Canadian way. Love that. I’m canadian
One thing I love about u is how u express ur views about movies when narrating them it makes me smile and I love ur voice
13:59 Hazarat e Kelly....
It’s a good day when Mystery Recapped uploads.
we all have that one lamar friend who always make bad decisions every minute. 
Man I love The Orville.
"Best way to escape any dangerous situation, just scream ""Omg!!! I take of my 90 year old Granma!!!"""
1:27 is that Seth MacFarlane?
OMG YS THERE IS A PART 2 YESSIRRRR
"Just going by the tagline, ants are still good then, the true dominant species on the planet."
Bro Kelly's story is such a unique weirdly related to how human acts sometimes
I’d heard of The Orville before but never watched it. Reminds me of the 90s show Sliders and that one episode of Black Mirror with Bryce Dallas Howard. I might have to check it out. 
This was interesting. Many different stories
I love how serious he makes a comedy show lol
"The statue wasn't a diety, it was someone prominent in their history"
This was such a great movie
"I really like this series .. I'm watching the newest ones on tv ,just yesterday .."
"Watch. The. Orville. This show is amazing. Really caught its stride and season 3 was seriously so so so good. It's funny, sweet, action packed, poignant."
I need to watch this series again
I love The Orville. Awesome show
This movie is a chaos and mix of Star Trek and some other series.
Btw congrats on reach three million. You derseve it. Because you give us content everyday. Congrats 
I love this show every episode is a masterpiece
6:27 POV you posted a unpopular opinion on r/unpopularopinions
This show is great
I didnt knew that Seth MacFarlane was in movies also  I know him from family guy 
Can't fkin stop listening to mystery reccaped I'm addicted
"Must be strange when the Captain's voice sounds like Peter Griffin from Family guy, LOL"
"Alara is one of if not THE number 1 character in my opinion, she’s fucking awesome
As a great captain once asked her “Alara can you open this jar of Pickles” anyone who watched the show will know"
"if we ever get to live on other planets in the future, there could be people who have a mars accent or even a proxima centauri B accent. "
Great season recap but how do I find part 2? I would recommend clearer titles referencing movie or series names on your videos.
"Great recap, one question: cant you just upvote yourself infinitly?"
"9:34 OOF that faceplant. poor rock.
allow me to introduce u two. Rock meet Face. Face, Rock."
"Ayo i watched all 3 seasons of this show, glad to see it finally given some attention!"
So... this what Goku & Vegeta feels everytime they go for Heaving training inside Hyperbolic time chamber.
You got me with Travis Scott 
This is very cool and reminds me of black mirror and star trek
I haven't watched it because I thought it would be comedic relief but dammm this series looks amazing
11:35 the woman drom dhar mann
"""Isaac being the smartest guy in the orbit""
meanwhile me : Isaac Newton is that u ?"
"It's a show,thanks for sharing"

"""Lt Lamarr""
So that’s what happened to Lamarr after being sent in that rocket"
Finally love this show
I watch 5 videos from Mystery Recapped and it's like I watch 5 movies in one day
The Travis Scott part got me dead
This took me such a long time to realize he's recapping Star Trek..
"The first episode is practically a little bit ""lighthearted"" (well at least as much as posible) version of Black Mirror's episode ""Nosedive""."
I instantly laughed when I saw seth MacFarlane
One word Beautiful 
"""I guess Reddit made it into the future"" "
"He's not just known for Family Guy. He also created American Dad, which is at least 10 times better, but The Orville is 100 times better than both combined. Season 3 is amazing."
"CPT. Mercer is a human, who is known for getting things done one way, or another.
He is also known for inventing Family Guy. lol "
…I would simply not ever visit that planet if there are other ones to explore 
I'm impressed you have made a comedy series and made it deadpan serious.
"I think the rings on xelayan would cover a bit of the planet, which makes the shadowed part inhabitable because:
Assuming there are also animals on the planet, their internal navigations would likely be disrupted, but i doubt this if the planet has had that ring since a young age, and that the animals have already adapted to it,
The rings would also heavily affect photosynthesis and the oxygen supply"
RIP TO QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Not a big fan of star trek but this was amazing show and lowkey made want to learn more of star trek
You're a savage for that Travis Scott joke! LMAO!
"""Travis scott won't survive on this planet""
Bros getting roasted hard"
"It makes no sense, imagine you lay flat on the ground and your leg breaks because is 10 times heavier. I can have 10 times the weight of my leg on my leg and I won't even feel it."
the best movie of my entire life
"love the show , reminds me of star trek obviously, but with that sense of humor that MacFarlane that is so good at .. been binging on it for a few hours, LoL, I think I better go do some work soon , but it is my day off sooo.."
This channel never fails to entertain️
"""Travis Scott wouldn’t stand a chance on this planet ""  LMAO"
Ohhh this is a series. I was gonna say! It did seem long.
I think you got a kind of like a spectrum of gravity and it doesn't work like that but you're damn near close but you can go from one gravity to another depending on what planet and actually build up just like they can build down and get their self in trouble living on our planet
Just found your channel mystery .
"I would have liked the Orville to have waited at that multiphase planet another 11 days just to see how different it would have been.
Edit: I have my answer after watching season 3! I am not disappointed. Keep it up, Seth MacFarlane."
I love love love this show.
I miss Orville. Loved the series. Wat hed up to se2 I think
If u haven't watched this TV show u should it's amazing and I've loved every min of it.
"Damn, I wish I can go to a planet where the gravity is 200 times less than that of earth"
"Reminds me of Star Trek Voyager season 6 episode 12 ""blink of an eye""."
I Been Wanting To Watch This Show & I Watched It In Mins
"0:17 ""ZELEYAN"""
1:06 try crushing tungsten
"Hey, let's make a time travel show... without the time travel.  That's what was going through my mind watching this"
I love so many crazy things in the modern world. This is one of them. You sound like the minecraft narrator my son listens to/watches
"Wow, this is a...... HEAVY subject. "
In reality they would've called Kelly a witch
"I love your consistency mystery recap, I've been following u since 100k subscribers"
"""travis scott wouldbt stand a chance on this planet"" go me laughing so bad"
Bodybuilders: I see this is an absolute win!
travis aint had to get violated like that :] :]
"Its important to note that that is almost exactly not how gravity works.

Like... none of that."
Alara returning to Xelayan is one of the saddest episode in the series... also Twitter Planet episode is really scary because we are kinda heading toward that path..
the orville crew find perfectly good planets and shenanigans ensue
0:39 but those bottle can withstand it's 10x weight
The moment when the observation subject advance pass the observer' civiliation.
"9:02 "" they are visiting world where the people stuck in the middle ages""

Oh shit they jumped into warhammer 40k get the fuck out there as fast as possible"
10x stronger gavity?u'll be super saiyan in no time...
Lol the 3rd earth in just 33 days managed to be as technological as orville
"""travis scott wouldn't stand a chance in this planet"" "
"Only Xelaya has crazy gravity, not Earth, but it had crazy gravity from the beginning."
Ending was silly and funny
Now I look up the titles before watching. Just to be sure it's not a series. Please state whether it's a series or movie before the end of the video. 
Wait.. 10 times the gravity?? Well 10 times 0 equals 0.
mystery reccaped has really come a long way i personally love watching their movie explanation than watching the whole movie 
why does it look like the people from the planet developed more advanced tech than those who come to the planet lol
This makes “calories are bad” a whole new level
It's amazing how many planets are out there that look just like earth and are somehow very similar to places where you can legally film on earth.
Fun fact: if a person from a different planet with stroger planet gravity stayed at a planet with weaker gravity will became weaker if stayed too long
That last one sounds oddly familiar 
I'd be giving myself One Million up-votes & likes daily if I had the chance to wear that thing on my chest!
"Red Dwarf: Who are you?
Orville: I'm you, but on Fox"
interesting story: can someone give me the link of movie please
This is basically Twitter if it was a planet 
Travis Scort wouldn’t stand a chance in this planet ️
Reminds me of that one Black mirror episode
So this is like a deadly version of Reddit?
"this is literally just 2022 Twitter and 2022 Everyday Life. I have to admit though, Seth was amazing at painting the future if we continue this way"
9:39 perfect example of why women should not be given any crucial tasks.
"I Actually Already Watched All The Episodes Of All The Current 3 Seasons Of The Orville, I Finished The Final Episode 3 Days Ago And I Checked Multiple Times In Case If I Missed And Episode But There's None And Now I'm Bored Waiting For Season 4. 
I Just Wanna See How Many Episodes You've Recapped So Far, Great Work With The Narration Keep It Up!! ️️️"
The Saiyan see the 10x planet like a GYM training without problem 
"This show is supposed to be a silly comedy, but somehow they managed to make it more of Start Trek than the modern Star Trek itself."
"In actual seriousness a high gravity planet with a dense atmosphere would probably see more ""sky settlements"" than anything else because flying and staying airborne is much, much easier in that environment than a low gravity, low density atmosphere. The REAL challenge though would be getting airborne again if you were to fall to the surface."
"I think this is what would happen if Facebook, Instagram, YouTube & all the other social media companies ended up ruling the world."
what is the name of this
I'm really waiting for s4 and hoping they don't cancel it like many shows are getting canceled nowdays
Whoever wrote this does not know how gravity works
I feel like this could actually happen eventually
"damn, this video convinced me to actually give the show a chance. thanks"
what is this movie called?
"so basicly twitter irl? yeah no i wouldent want to live in a society like this

edit: nvm  i just saw the medival planet"
"""The Xeleyans are the strongest beings in the universe"".
The Saiyans: ""Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary"""
13:17 the person on this planet and Kelly have the same anotomy for the healing gun to work?
"""Perhaps if it were 500 times, you might have something, but 10?"" ""I don't even feel it."" - Vegeta"
This definitely has to be a comedy
Seth MacFarlane is one of those actors who actually is a national treasure. And people generations from now will still know who he is. I love Seth MacFarlane what would we all do without him? I'm serious
I like this movie but wow i thought they wont use the eletric chair anymore
"""Hence, their best chance to escape the correction is to prepare a perfect apology speech. Travis Scott wouldn't stand a chance on this planet.""

Neither Jake Paul, Will Smith, or Sienna Max would survive a jiffty on the planet and would already be corrected in a heartbeat"
"I remember watching this movie 3 years ago, it was a great movie and I loved all of the parts."
"That last one reminds me of the Star Trek Voyager episode Blink Of An Eye, where a planet moved faster through time than everyone else."
"Some stories are interesting.  However, it still feels like a Star Trek knockoff in many ways, including the plots.  There was an episode in Star Trek voyager where a primitive planet had faster time than the rest of the universe.  Voyager’s onboard hologram doctor spent many years on the planet, while the ship in the orbit had watched the rapid development on the planet.  And the alien planet eventually become even more advanced than the Federation ship from the 24th century earth.  Near the end of the episode, the aliens sent two ships to meet Voyager, and one of them teleported himself onboard.   Tell me these plot arrangements are not near identical."
"Well, at least we know that if this becomes the future, we can know to wear a suit.
Edit: I got 2nd  like on this video."
What's the name of the movie?
Tbh if this was real earth it  wont exist cause even if atleast 5 percent of earth's gravity increases then earth whould crash into sun well before it crash it whould be litteral dust
"Created AND starring seth MacFarlane but live action instead of animated like family guy? Wow!!

1:17 Seth is 48??!?!!! How much make up is this guy wearing?"
Orville is a great successor for star trek
I love the part we’re they go to the planet that has 10x stronger gravity 
"Fact: The role of Capt. Mercer is played by Seth MacFarlane, the one who gave his voice to PETER,STEWIE,QUAGMIRE and BRIAN in the show THE FAMILY GUY. Just letting ppl know ;)

EDIT:lol when i saw Seth, i instantly wrote the comment and the moment I resumed the video, adam already said it."
FIRST /NEVER GONNA GIVE U UP
This reminds me of Star Trek
1.16 why is Peter Griffin in this 
2nd view
"This idea is basically identical to the Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"". Seth MacFarlane is pretty shameless for this one."
I never thought such a cool star trek ish TV show with comedy could be narrated and themed like a serious dramatic movie.
"""Travis Scott wouldn't stand a chance on this planet"" OMG that caught me off guard."
I love issac it looks SO COOL cool robot
Funny personality narrator well done
this show has some funny moments and i wish  it had more seasons.
When the ship flys in space it reminds me of the movie predator
So literally the episode of Futurama but deadlier. Brannigan Begin Again.
"""And then they went to another planet... that was also like Earth""
Crazy."
"I love this show so much. For a show rated for 14+, I am shocked how many adult comments they can throw in this. It's hilarious, though, and shows the maturity that kids have nowadays."
Whats the name of this show ??
this guy's narrating just cracks me up
Lamarr is the Paul Logan of that world lol.
I hope this is our ending 
Pls what is d name
I remember this episode of The Orville.
"""He's also known for inventing Family Guy"" ....love it"
What is the name of the movie?????
"I would love do live in this world, im weiting for future"
2:10 OMG WAIT BEFORE YOU ELECTRECUTE HIM PUT A MASK OR SOMETHING ON HES HEAD OR HES LIKE EYES ARE GONNA POP OUT
Wow this is similiar to that one black mirror episode
"I tried to watch this but it feels like aliexpress star trek and I wish it had more of its own identity, the concepts it's playing with are really compelling"
what movie is this
This movie should get an Oscar
Reminds me of an episode of Sliders
5:52 
Would love to live in a ultra futuristic world
"""travis scott wouldnt be able to do the apology"""
"""yo wassup dude""
""ayyyy sup man"" 
""lets go to mars
""sure dude lesgo"""
"this isn’t because of the year that makes the gravity stronger but it just simply another planet, not earth. i know because i’m a huge fan of the orville series and i do really hope they release the 4th season"
"Sooooooooooooooo.........was that 11 Day Planet like brand new when they got there? Like, what era was it on like a month before they got there?"
I am a huge fan I love you 
"I think i remember when this was a new show starting out. I thought it was like start trek or something. 

On another note, i thought of how if you were being flattened by the gravity, even if they pick you up youd be crushed."
Your voice is soo cool
Peter Griffin is the captain of a spaceship? Wow! Hehehehehehehe....
The social credit score system of this movie is the scariest part.
"OMG, Seth MacFarlane!!!"
"1:32 LOL Congratulations, you got yourself a Subsriber.

Sargas-4 Basically China If the Rule the world. and that Voting Machine is ""Next Evolutionary Of Social Credits"""
I love that show ️
"After watching all your other videos hearing this voice instantly makes me think something terrible is about to happen. But it turns out its just the Orville, and totally awesome sci fi show"
This is a tv show for one .. for two .. it’s like several episodes all mushed together for part 1 & 2
Wouldn't they be incredibly dense and crush anything or have violent decompression in a low gravity atmosphere?
Best part of the video. 1:01
The fact that it fills like their telling us about different planets and stuff it doesn't even have a lot of clips with 10x weight only at da begging of the vidoe
1:33 like the show???? :D wow!
Omg i stan issac
its funny because i love this show the orville and theses episodes are out of order and ed the captain is lay back af
Daaamn this is interesting
you had one job Lamar
"girl, we ain't makin it to 2418"
"1:28 if you dont know thats seth mcfarlane he invented family guy and voices peter griffin , quagmire etc"
the Orville is the best space movie tbh
"Ive watched the orville yall should actually watch the series, even if he explained some of the episodes. The show sometimes handle srs topics but can be funny at the same time."
"""Its looks just like Earth"" - yeah, to save costs on sets. In almost every sci-fi series (stargate, firefly) almost all planets is ""just like Earth"". Also, this  multiphase planet greatly surpassed Earth developement in the end of story. Just imagine that they would see when it reappears again!
However, space exploration isnt posible to this planet, since its constantly ""jumps"" to 700 years in future."
"Xelaya a planet in The Orville series 
Xelaya's gravitational pull was many times greater than the planetary average. Living creatures like Xelayans and eevaks had power and strength many times that of species from other worlds. Visiting species, such as Humans, survive on the planet only through the use of special protective technologies like environmental suits and gravity shields"
Is one of the guys from the Brady bunch?
This is basically Twitter if a planet 
It’s the space balls of Star Trek 
What happens if you press the green your self???
"but if you pay attention
the USS ORVILLE
is slower than a
STAR TREK runabout"
This is like watching an explanation from someone who doesn't understand what they were watching 
"30 seconds into the narration, and I already can't stand the idea that ""a protective suit"" can help you avoid stronger gravity."
Is this a movie or a series? This movie is making me nostalgic for the tv show SLIDERS
I love this new Star Wars movie with no lightsabers or sith
Nice story
"""look a can crushes then i talk about something unrelated for 15 minutes"""
3:11 is that one of the grannies from “Gangster Granny” fake audition video
Movie name..?
"""Travis Scott wouldn’t last on this planet.”  dude tosses shade like it's nothing"
"The man speaking in this videoclip mention that one of the planet in The Orville is Xelayan, but it's Xelaya and the species living there is Xelayans "
Speed runs on planets are real in this movie
that's planet vegeta right there
This moive is literally just that episode Black mirror episode nose dive
Didnt know Seth made a Black Mirror episode
It's how much gravity is pulling  them
"The low-gravity planet shown was Sargus 4, not Earth"
None of this would be possible in 10× gravity
this looks like any VFX school final project
Now this is why we dont see aliens often :)
They have spaceships but still have the electric chair
Surely that last planet will evolve extremely fast and get far more advanced than the rest of the galaxy
The God Humper lmaoooo
Let’s say this guy knows a lot about predicting the future.
"Travis scoot wouldn't stand a chance in this planet 
Lamao shots fired"
Every planet is *just like Earth*. An incalculable coincidence and very useful for the production budget.
Movie name?
"good job robot, the best result is always on the fine line between cosmic fuckup and perfect solution"
I have watched all episodes of The Orville 
"""But lamar being lamar he continu-"""
orville?  like the popcorn?
They can fly in normal earth gravity right?
Lamar got what he had comin.
"“10 times the gravity of Earth, that’s easy!” - Vegeta"
Just imagine going on vacation to another planet. That’s just wild! This actually looks like a decent sci-fi. It must’ve disappeared bc of a different dimension or reality
"""Oh my God. . . they were roommates."""
When does Alex Mercer became a Xelayan’s great leader?
First. Unless gravity is a  Sentient being how does it know to apply what amount of force to everything in the world.
Glad this had a good ending
"If I’m being honest, this is how so many things here on earth are messed up… . This is how!"
I can’t believe I didn’t know this wasn’t Star Trek
"It's too bad they ditched the humor in season 3. The humor was what made it great. I also didn't like the decision to make Issac betray them. He was easily my favorite character and even after his ""redemption"" he just wasnt the same."
The world became a hyperbolic time chamber... cool  
I have been thinking that maybe earth enters different universes such as one in the show. Explains strange phenomenons that happen maybe this is what seth was trying to imply?
I'm glad I wasn't around in that time lol
"""hehehehe hey lois look im a god"""
travis scott lmfao bro
this is walle and star wars mixed into one
SOOOOO What we need is an ISACC??
Modern day Star Trek.
All 5 people on board the submersible:
I know they got the idea for this movie after a Futurama episode.
"Honestly, that kinda behaviour would have him fired from The Orville too..."
The GOD humper️️
Infact 10X gravity reminds me about king kais world in dbz
ayooooooooooooo the humper be doin it on a mannequin
Just imagine the aliens are none other than such guys visiting earth frequently 
"""Travis Scott Wouldn't Stand A Chance In This Planet"""
I didnt even notice seth macfarlane
"Travis Scott after watching this.
Et tu mystery et etu!!"
They gave Seth McFarlane a role in such a cheezy movie... he he he.
"Wait, isn’t dis a different movie?"
I found this through full stop punctuation lmao
Wait... this is part of the Startreck franchise?
This is basically an episode of black mirror
It looks like Star Trek
Kinda crazy how they got Peter Griffin in live action tho
Ohhh black mirror
Goku and Vegeta would have no problem. Maybe a slight inconvenience at 500x gravity
Is lieutenant Lamar's first name Kendrick?
that plant is just twitter
Don't want to push my own buttons but I will lol
If the gravity increase in the future..the gravity must be so low in past..that the people can levitate easily 
I think it is not possible life to evolve even one foot height if the gravity is such high at that planet.
Just another day in Planet Vegeta.
My name is Isaac too
Species evolved under harsh environment to fits into it...
"""Travis Scott wouldn't stand a chance on this planet"" LMFAO"
Wow... So many ridiculous things.
WOWW WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY??
captain looks so much like my uncle ._.
So some of the ideas Black Mirror’s Nosedive got the inspiration from this show?
Humans in this movie:I HAVE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP
Do they go super Xelayaian?
Zeliyan???
What are you talking about? The 10x more gravity was in like 3 episodes later?
bruh that is space trek
It's not like the gravity will change overnight. Humans and all other life forms will evolve accordingly.
pfft this is nothing me and Vegeta are training on 100x gravity for 5 days now in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber
So basically king Kai’s planet
"This is an entire Series, this is only one part of it guys"
Seth?!
What's the name pls
"The Name is ""The Orville"""
he said mallory when it statded it was malloy
Lol it turn into necron tomb world XD.
Best ruling system.
Seth McFarlane is also there
Lamar shld have controlled himself lol
Lamar sound exactly like a Lamar
"Goku would be thrilled for this to happen, just saddened that the humans would suffer because of it."
Always looks like earth and always will 
This doesn't make sense. Higher gravity should mean less bone density as to compensate for the effect of your bones becoming too heavy to carry themselves.
7:08 NEITHER DID ANYONE ELSE! :p
Is this Star Trek
I love the idea of the voting system lol 
This episode sounds familiar almost like we are living it?
Why you had to bring up Travis Scott ??
Looks like EVE Online or smth
"So part 2001 , part Futurama and part ,idk Monty python"
"If that happened in real life, Nicocado Avocado would create a black hole vacuum! "
I love his little jokes
Issac more like Issac newton
Is this Star Trek
"If you're on pc or laptop, press 1 3 4 6, all sound ""ur"" lol"
STAR TREK AGAIN ???
Is this the new Star Trek series 
"Alara  was a cool character, but when she and Seth broke up in real life it must have had something to do with her character leaving because it happened right after the breakup. I guess I wouldn't want to work with my ex either. Who would really. This show is way underrated especially that first season."
Apparently Ford still exist on other planets. Ford is a humanoid cannon event for all planets
and here we dont have enough air to breathe
"Mom can we get Star trek while we're out?
We have Star Trek at home."
Worshipping Kelly was mostly half of this recap for the series.
"Gravity is 10x stronger and humans are crushed.
Sayains: ""Pathetic."""
Wouldn't it have been easier to take 'lame-ar' back to the ship 
he deserves to be corrected...
Goku would love Zeleyan
Remember when this was about gravity-? Yeah- me neither.
How would a suit protect anyone from gravity?
Saiyins would laugh at this
"lmao, got this as autoplay, what is this? scuffed startrek?"
Might as well just call it the uss popcorn man
"Omg, they have planet Reddit"
Sounds like planet vegeta
"This is why I hate studying Physics. I can't even enjoy sci-fi movies anymore, the inaccuracies are all that I can see. I never thought I'd hate having knowledge"
that’s why you don’t skip leg day 
Why do I think this is the future of humanity?
Me and my boys training to become stronger like Goku and Vegeta who trains in x100 gravity
hence
"I love the idea of different worlds, exploring the universe and beyond ️  it's fascinating. That ""voting society"" is scary, it's like social credit system in China, isn't it? I wonder how social figures, celebs and politicians woul survive there, there would have to be some protection for them, but would be no controversial influencers as it'd be too risky. It's scary to depend on social media users/tik tokers vote."
"You did extremely well with this.

With almost everything."
1:01
"Zel-e-on?
No."
Still better than Star Trek Discovery or Picard.
@1:34 aaaaahahahahaaaaa....giggity.
And ( leap time)
Basically Black Mirror
">it looks just like earth
aka we didn't have the budget"
"Soooo, basically all we need is :
- alien to spoof every media source availabe
- alien is shielded against any and all forms of weaponry
- alien has best intent in mind for the entire planets ecosystem (everything & everyone)"
Oh no
Reddit made it into the future 1:50
4:01 chinese social credit system
Mallory lol
"And in like Season 3 those same time diluted aliens fucks with them but they had a reason to. Of course the guys in the Orville were not happy but they did kinda forgave them cause they did set them on that path. Nobody died, just a scared and pissed off crew."
nice
"'Xelayans' is pronounced ""Zel-AY-uns"""
star trek spinoff
0:12 I can see my name
She had to touch the ocean did she
I miss Alara so much.
So just hack his credit badges or just turn up and take him  so much for a captain that gets shit done
"damn, saiyans irl"
Wow looks like Dbz sayins are evoleing to humans
They could just have him leave the mission right? And replace em?
I wouldn't be surprised if Lamar is the type of guy that dies first in Horror movie
"I wonder how much they paid him, cause I wouldn’t…"
10X PL home depot sells it...
I think we would more likely just pass out from the blood not pumping properly. Strain our heart and be hard to breath. I don’t think our bones would crush
What is the name of the movie
"The photo on the face of this post is the walking dead, not a crushed body."
The Orville is ridiculous but entertaining
"Narrator, your Canadian accent came out."
Travis Sccot 
Watch out and take care…
In Kelly we trust
Hey it's Seth
He was basically asking to be corrected
This is also a black mirror episode lol
Also known as the voice of Ted. I’m guessing that badge only recognizes different fingerprints otherwise I’d just be hitting the up vote non stop.
would not the future be futuristic
Ah this is the movie where that weird headed guy tries smoking and he fell inlove with it.
Seems like someone been watching DBZ
This documentary on China's social credit system is great!
So we hang out with aliens in the future...cool
"Bruv those aren't different planets, they are just traveling back in time."
"Fun fact - human staying on orbit quickly lose their bone mass and muscules due to low gravity. So, this high gravity superstrong girl will be much less strong in no time on this ship."
"Me: I know that guy
Him: he's also famous for inventing Family Guy
Me: SETH!!"
"If King Vegeta can do over 500x’s Earth’s gravity training, we should be able to do 10x’s at the very least "
This is just current USA. They sure were spot on with this prediction.
I am impressed that their skin is harder than titanium I mean it's gravity.....how????
"So, this is the place where Goku trained."
So this is 418 years  in the future    ayooo imagine that
Nah bro recapped a two season long show and the good place do walking dead next
What the name of the movie??
"Man, They really recorded earth and called it “ Sargas 4 “"
And i tought i could train like goku in higher gravity
This actually seems where we are a headed
“I guess Reddit made it into the future” LOL 
What is name of series
what if there was some people in space that just saw there planet disappear and never come back as they wonder for years until they die
"To summarize, Jesus Christ was an alien on a slower time line."
"""in Year 42069, people ARE the Twitter"""
the second planet is like Rick and Morty where they worship Kelly but in Rick and Morty he was an evil God lol
Ain't  this like star trick from wish
but whats the name of the movie
bro this is star treak
"""Travis Scott won't stand a chance on this planet"" "
when a parody series is better than some of the recent Star trek shows 
"Ah, so they're Saiyans"
Damn i would hate to live there
"This feels awfully familiar, is this supposed to be like a modern day Star Trek with a different name same plot?"
can't they search on a future version of google to find out abt the two scientists?
everything has to be us or united... cannot grow out of the feeling that 13% of the world is not the world's voice
(Added) Bucket list: Watch movie with Mystery recapped guy
The Character Lamar is absurd.
Like a rejected black mirror episode.
cant they just teleport him to spaceship?
I wonder how much effort and money was put to make this movie
I wonder how much effort and money was put to make this movie
"When earth is referred to as ""low gravity"" my inner scifi writer is screaaming. If the gravity on earth was much higher, we would not be able to send rockets into outer space."
Social credit system future is not a conspiracy theory
Star Trek meets Black Mirror.
Wow I already hate that planet.
bro really had to do reddit like thattt auughhh
"What I expect: Space gore. Everyone is punished with Gravity. Gravity is used as a weapon. Gravity had a major role in the story.



What I got: Wacky Woohoo Reddit Planet with extra time travel shenanigans."
Why is everything crushed in 10G??
Isn't this star trek or
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but is this a Star Trek parody?"
Fun fact isn’t a movie but a series
Lamar is a troll hahahhahaha
Me like: OMG ICE CREAM STILL EXISTS???
so pretty much Earth's history
Oh yeah can she flip an island?
"Wouldn't a species from a dense gravity planet not only be stronger, but also be heavier, too?"
Seems real to me
It baffles me that they don't bring weapons when they visit a planet.
"This begs the question in real life do we also happen to move through universes and theres an alien which monitors us every few days or weeks for them while for us its millennials, meaning last they saw us was while we were vikings so they were not interested, would also explain why theres nk contact because we still havnt gone back to the other universe for them to make contact we are in that 11 day missing period what yall think?"
couldn't you just keep hitting your own up vote
They are literally kryptonians
Lesson : dont bring lamar anywhere
Doesnt china have this with their social credit score.
"""travis scott wouldnt last on this planet"" LMFAO"
Did they copy Black Mirror or did Black Mirror copy them?
Vegeta : 
honestly that kind of world with votes is pretty dope
The rest is from a black mirror episode lol
4:30 it's always their kind
Is this a Star trek parody?!
Conspiracy theory fuel
finally collabrate with aliens 
"""I guess reddit made it to the future"" good one ahhahaha"
I hear Elon musk is a big fan of the Sargasso IV version of democracy.
Its from a tv show
If real life was like reddit they would just have to lock me in the correction chair
This movie sounds like if social media decided all justice in the world
Hell naw imagine this planet has twitter
ya just make everything chrome if it's futuristic
Can we get an Isaac and Kelly to come here
"There could actually be truth to this, if know how heavy and dragged down can feel like illuminated. It's constantly efforts to move against the drag force. Become less active, also because tire of living with the drag down. Even if very excited to be with other people, have great plans with them, are still pulling oneself around. Takes alot of the joy and fizz out of life, makes a procrastinator out of, but don't really know what have to do, that procrastinating about. Just exist for the amount of greed involved in the system. Forced to live the truth about that, no matter how much deception."
"StarTrek Copy kkkk In the series, has a episode that one plantet do this same kind of thing, disapear and return in days, but in the planet the people pass year and years"
"This isn't too farfetched as far as gravity is concerned; we humans already struggle with 1g, and especially so with 2g!
Social Credit going mad, notwithstanding."
Seth Mc is the best
movie name?
(Xelaya -> planet) (Xelayan -> species)
Social credit system...predictive programming anyone?
So this is why the quality of family guy deteriorated rapidly.
"its pronounced ' ""sa-lay-a' the planet is is called 'Xelaya' the speices are called 'xelayan'"
"I would love the 24/7 hardcore training from the heavy planet if I wouldn't weight 800kg, a 3x - 5x planet would be enough

Also democratic social credits, now that's an idea for the CCP to try out"
5:50 Click This Part
"ye but wait.....yes , on mega planets with 10x..or 100x etc gravity lower gravity woven materials or creatures will have effects but and in scifi you can make those ..extreme...
but... shouldet that also mean the reverse ,like ...sure miss evolved on a world with 100x gravity compared to x material mean she can treat it like clay...
but.... it also mean on a 'low' gravity world miss 100x more..denser.. material made body mean that even the bedrock be like quicksand...shouldet it ? if being extreme so to speak
ehh...yeee right , sorry but democratic also means being diplomatic aspects of ...you cant kill external ambassadors etc willy nilly"
"the only thing about
THE ORVILLE series
that annoys me is
almost every race has"
It's aka social credit system.
Wouldn’t we just end up just like goku if we had 10x gravity? 
"Also known as having created ""Family Guy"" "
Alara was a good character. too bad she moved on out of the series.
Yeesh and to think that the saiyans lived under 10x gravity for a living not to mention the low class saiyans 
"This seems awfully suspicious to star trek 
episode or is it just me"
USS Orvel
The gravity part is pretty neat but then you have to worry about your spicy reddit threads sentencing you to death.
What happened to Lamarr??
"Fun fact:10x gravity is not enough to actually break your bones or crush you,humans can survive twice and half that"
Is it me only that thinks xeliyans are similar to saiyans. The whole 10x gravity and super strength
The concept of celebrities wouldnt work in this world
"Hell nah, they made Twitter a planet"
Sounds like social credit to me ngl
so he basically ripped off nosedive from black mirror lol
"Humans would adapt to the 10x gravity, slowly, but they will do it, they will just become super buff."
So none of this was about the 10x gravity?
Kelly sees her own statue be like: oh f*ck.
Is this not Seth MacFarlane?
Movie name: the orville
So It’s like… Twitter took over the planet?
What Is This 2021 - 2022 ??
Most powerful person - CAMERAMAN
Lol. A mere 10x gravity allows you to crush titanium into a ball? 
"When story is awful, think how movie will be "
isn't it star trek?
"Black mirror."" Nose Dive"" episode"
Is it just me or does it sound like Isacc is  impersonating DATA.
The beings on that planet would probably be just as strong as Superman.
Nosedive. Basically.
And I thought there was no tictok hell
So this is what Malarkey got up to after world war 2
10x gravity is nothing for Saiyans like Vegeta to jump freely. XD
So these are saiyan´s? 10 gravity planet? Strongest warriors in the universe? 
This is getting canceled on a WHOLE NEW level 
This is pretty much a  Black Mirror episode...
"The US is getting closer to this. Ushering in ""likes"" on social media for practice"
Would ten times gravity really instantly crush metal like that? I mean I realize you would ten times heavier but still?
He's only talking about one episode lmao
You can not reshape titanium with your bare hands even if you were born on a planet with 10x earth gravity lol.
I wish you got the name of the aliens correct…
"In the future the place turns into a future place, not the sharpest knife in the draw are you"
I wonder how earth will be in 3000 year. We all would be dead by now at that time by now.
10x higher gravity = crushes titanium which would need hundreds-thousands of times more strength
If Twitter was a planet and its economy was reddit... worse place to live ever
Orwellian Society also called MOB RULE
How old is this show? Looks very old…
This is star trek
If twitter was a planet
"Somehow the random badge gived to him is link to him even tho none of those badge are ""registered"" to him lol (random seller giving it to them) 
I was expecting a crimanal doing something bad resulting in raising is downvotes ... Didint expect the raising of downvote caused by his little dance lol that hurt my brain as the whole story is around those badge xD"
Humanity if there were no toxic players
And yup i should avoid this type of users.
Aren't the story ideas from black mirror? The writers just changed minor stuff
3:58 500k downvotes? Damn I've never even saw 500k people my entire life.
the writing seem to be subpar in this series
Sadly the newest season of the Orville isn't as good as the other 2.
isaac went down there and fathered a whole infrastructure for a planet
The second I saw Seth ik this was gonna be an “oh fuck  this shits gonna be funny”
The lighter gravity is could end all life if we could drop gravity as low as .01 g then all life end instantly
Dude has to make sarcasm of Seth dont ya
The planet (skip time)
"Saiyans, Hold our beer"
Lamarr really doing nothing right here
Why did auto play get me here? 
Earth would have to be be 10x as massive to have 10x stronger gravity though.
star trek btw
So do all videos use fake thumbnails now?
"this is exactly what we human on earth are doing,"
Literally the Orville is practically a parody/spoof of star trek and THIS is the thing you focus on about it? Huh?????
"False:  The titanium crushed cube would have been red hot, no way those febal fingers could have held on to it."
sargas 4 is quite literally Reddit in a nutshell
Are hollywood writers bored???
"This reminds me off Corona , for not wearing a cloth"
"Child falls.
Kelly heals the wound.
The child and family: ....
Kelly: you guys won't worship me right? "
Interstellar when????????
"Kelly alike hindu goddess "" kali"""
The persons responsible for writing these scripts need 'Corrected' Imo
how did he get 93 million votes by someone spamming OMG HE LOVES HIS 90 YR OLD GRANDMA
Umm it had like almost nothing to do with the name of the video
How hard is it to do a proper apology speech Lamar? It’s like he wanted to be electrocuted.
"So gravity is 10x stronger, but human beings born there look just the same?

Right................."
Zargas 4 legit is a real life version of Reddit
"They screwed that alien planet up royally. In what way is it ""fixed""?"
"Lamarr needs to be corrected. And no, I won't be watching a movie with a toilet seat for a spaceship."
"""The planet which has now transformed into 21st century earth""... Sorry, what? It's a different planet! What are you on about?!"
tbh I dont think U watched it
"10x? Pretty sure 10x isn't nearly enough to demonstrate these effects... Like, you can literally step on someone or stand on them completely without breaking their bones or damaging stuff, and that's 80~kg pressing on an area of a leg or two..."
"if the gravity is 10 times stronger, the people there should have 10 times less density to survive"
Ms Perkins had to escape earth because she broke the rules of the continental.
But what if you weight 0 kg? Or 0 ibs
Travis Scott wouldn’t stand a chance Lol
so the 10x gravity point had aboslutley nothing to do with the plot of the movie
Ridicuous premise
"There is only one way to explain why giant animals once existed yet do not, and could not exist now, gravity has increased. Yes, that's the answer. Gravity will increase again, it doesn't do it slowly but in sudden huge steps."
What’s lysellas @?
Life imitates art:  This is what China is moving into
"you really gotta work on that accent with your ""sory"" ;)"
"Kelly: heals one person. Gets worshipped like a god.

Jesus: am I a joke to you?"
Umm…people used to think the Earth was flat..that Earth was going to be destroyed by 2012..and yet……
Bruh how could he just die because of dancing
"Lol titanium is like 100x less compressible than water, crushing a block to half the size means her hands are roughly 5,000,000 times stronger than atmospheric pressure (which is already much stronger than humans, not sure by how much), not 10x"
"If gravity works like that then why bugs, insects or smaller animals are able to live on Earth?"
wow cool
Essentially superman syndrome she has superpowers on the Orville but would be normal on her own world
"He spams ""Lamar supports his 90 year old grandma"""
This is worse then our democracy if America came like this I'd be mad.
Star trek
In which episode the downvote thing happens.
"This is “Cancel Culture” or “Being tried in a court of public opinion”, which is exactly how social media is manipulating us lately."
This is conceptualisation of the mark of the beast
"wow, didn't know Arabic numerals would be so popular across the galaxy.."
Travis Scott wont stand a chance on this planet 
"So basically Kelly is like Jesus, a person who people's thought to be a God since  long times ago."
No body is ever gonna see the world 2100 even
I see shorts like this and one of then said what is this then the human said its a cigarette and in the ship he said to spawn 500 cause its so yummy
Sounds like a demo Planet
Love Steph but saw him and assumed it was a funny film.
Those badges are a great metaphors for the social credit system in China. Pray this doesn’t happen in the west
This summary is wayyyyy of
Isn't the badged voting society concept stolen from an episode of Sliders?
It's family guy voice actor
All the killer is corruption.
"Ah yes, the Chinese Social Crediting structure in sci fi."
"Lamar and his actions are quite frankly pissing me off. 
I've never visited another country and imposed my own norms on the people there. That's like being a spray painter, going to North Korea and spray painting over Kim Jun Uns face, cause in California you just spray paint over everything. Like What???"
"Errrrm, black mirror anyone?"
laughing Vegeta noises
Social rating nightmare
And it's  pronounced SIL LAY AH
No need to tell us as we will not exist till then 
"Nope creatures living in high gravity planet would probably be like giant squids , no bones and being giant for the pressure, but in out Planet they would be much smaller"
Why not just rescue lamar?
So from the movie all I got was the people lack discipline
Travy patty scott
i died so many times in reddit
This is not a joke and someday   it will happen but the problem is not the gravity but the heat from the sun. .the heat from the sun will burn everything. .
This is not a joke and someday   it will happen but the problem is not the gravity but the heat from the sun. .the heat from the sun will burn everything. .
"10x gravity..
So we didn't become saiyans?
Lame"
Can’t imagine people in America
you know that means u cant use the bathroom
Honkai starails
"Not bad. Not great, but considering in how many wakes they must try to survive in, or if you prefer, what power of vacuum there is remaining as previous franchises have begun to seriously suck…whatever. Have fun living in a perpetual spiral."
"Ah yes, Reddit the planet."
Aaaa... There is something like evolution so I doubt it would be crashed by the gravity. Probably it will destroy itself
I’m impressed that The people kept up a religion around Kelly for 700 years. That’s impressive
That's why earth is not flat
Travis Scott wouldn’t stand a chance on this planet lol
The up vote and downvote system was a great representation of what social currency might be like in the future.
Black Mirror did it better 
"You mean 
He's also know for copying The Simpsons"
Goku could handle it
"No, Our Bones will become Stronger"
Must have been a great movie dammit
This society would suck so bad
can they beat goku tho? 
This is not to far off from China's current social credit system....
My god dude.. This is not what The Orville is about.. you just made a big click bait video.. sad.
this is the kind of culture that the US is going to.
Lamarr was truly out of line and endangered his life and the lives of his squad. He should have known better than to do anything peculiar when visiting a culture they know little about.
I couldn’t tell if this was a comedy or not.
zargas 4 is reddit getting turned into a planet
"this Episode 7 ,Majority Rule & 12,Mad Idolatry ,,"
"IF GRAVITY changes as much as you say, either humans will have to get stronger or fie long before tgen."
me releasing its a movie
So they travelled to China
Bro I'm in 2023 rn and this isn't even close to what we have rn
"Who voted this guy to be a Captain.

Planet that had never had a contact with Aliens. Sends a person with distinguished alien features on her head."
travis scoot did nothing
Sound more like the social score like the one use in china by the ccp
Aliens
"Honestly, homeboy need correcting. How you gonna land on an alien planet and start dancing on their statues like you know thats harmless or something, honestly, mans a liability"
Lysella looks cute
"No one else bothered by the fact that after another 11 days, we'll be worshiping that planet the other way round instead?"
this show has potential cept seth keeps sleeping with all the female leads... breaking up with them and then they leave lol
"I'm so impressed nobody got mad at ""no  humping"" rule.
It isn't a felony."
Every other movie… Social Engineering.
"Kelly's not a God, but a Goddess!! "
STAR TREK RIPOFF
Is this show a dark comedy?
Sounds complicated I would’ve just listened & made observations instead of making contact with any human Lol they went through a lot
This guy clearly never actually watched the show
Kelly ach bar
"Now i am convinced that our reality has been tampered with, chances most of you are not living in the same world you remember as a kid, how come a movie like this is not popular???... something is not right, NOBODY IS ASKING QUESTIONS AND NOBODY TO MONINTOR THESE THINGS."
I ain’t going to see this bc I’m die in 100 years
"too bad johny somalia never watched this movie before he made a fool of himself during his visit to Japan..
Lamar really embodiment of what buffoonery could lead you into..."
"Not even 10 people saw her healing someone and the whole planet suddenly started worshipping her without a question. 
Hmmm I wonder where I have seen this before."
Ok I know the titles of these Recapped videos have always been a bit off but WHAT THE FUKK!
lois
Imagine guys getting killed because someone made a dark joke and gets downvoted to eternity
It breaks the illusion when you need to make a character act THAT stupid in order to drive the plot.
Famous Forgeting things done I know I know
"Why didn't Kelly maintain that she is a God, but doesn't want people killed in her name, and then proceed to make laws for the governance of society? They erred majorly in that one."
Kelly is not a god.......she is a goddess!!
"Hmm a person appears and heals someone and them peasants worship her for millenias. 

Where do I have heard of that before?!"
oh snap... Reddit made it to the future...
Cool
25th Century
KELLY HU SNACKBAR
The problem for Lamar is that I would have downvoted him too. He was a total obnoxious jerk.
If reddit was a movie:
Star strek
Bruh just because they didnt give the woman a seat that happened to them bruh!
AYO DAT’S CAP
5:45 why would you humor their laws and legal system instead of just leaving the planet?
social credit in china
They stole that upvote down vote thing completely from early seasons of black mirror. Id sue them .
Ok
hmm human this planet trasport to 1 ton payload in this planet rocket size is same to N1-l3
this is so original oh wait is not it has been done in the black mirror and if the badges were so easily obtained i would change them as soon as i would get too many downvotes
Could he not just leave the planet
Man just explained chistianity
Redditors: my time has come
No such thing as gravity
Barbie from Agents Of Shield is worshipped as a god in this one...wow.
"Are you intentionally mispronouncing all the names, or have you just never watched the show before?"
This is some serious - Jesus is alien implications.
"My brothers in Christ, we must evolve into chad lopsiders to continue the human legacy"
Sounds like China's Social Credit score.
"I’m waiting on Jesus to return just to tell us he is some regular guy from the future, and he just time traveled back into time to woah everyone by walking on water and to make people think he was gods son "
Damn the series looks great. Glad Seth could move away from Family Guy and continue his carrier.
Redditor's perfect world
Humanity being failures once again for the infinitieth time?:0
oh god no not the reddit world
cooollll
"Lamar cant catch a fuckin break bro LMFAOOOO ""forcibly high fiving the audience 9 million downvotes lmaooooo"""
This is basically just like china currently
Why don't they just take him to space again? Hhhh
A planet of Sayians...
Lamar gave me secondhand embarrassment.
So why waste money to visit other planets?
Lamar was committing suicide.....he was secretly depressed
"Wtf is up with these titles. This show has nothing to do with gravity at all, not even a little bit."
Ayo they copied star trek or star trek copied them first
"In other words, China in a few years... also the rest of the world if COVID had ""continued""."
"For a second I thought he said ""Captain CrackHead"
this upvote and downvote is what the chinese currently use in social credit score
"Really? “Travis Scott wouldnt last on this planet?“ ️
…Cringe…"
Let's all just be honest Seth Farland just wanted to be the captain of Star Trek because that's exactly what this is a cheap knockoff version of Star Trek with poor acting the ships look like star trek and the outfits are just 100% almost identical to star trek
Nonsense all are from human work. Do u think u can challenge the Creators
Honestly Lamar doesn't deserve to be saved
"planet: ""gravity crushed humans with their own weight""
fat activism: ""this whole planet is fatphobic"""
Sounds like Chinas Social Credit system
i hope im not the only one thinking that this is some kind of star trek rip off
Kelly is gorgeous and good making her a great choice of being a God. You don't have to be immortal just good. Think of what the proper leadership of a good person is capable of. Also a planet 10x the gravity of earth would have to be huge made of a proton number in atomic weight that it would resemble a sun. Jupiter has a gravity of somewhere in the middle around 2.5 as it's a thousand times bigger than the earth a 1/1000th the size of our sun.
Twitter opinion is the law the movie.
The first planet was entirely pointless…
"it's a sci-fi COMEDY so don't take it too seriously, people xP"
Likes And Dislikes Are Off Balance and cannot describe adequately a person or a situation.Dont get Enslaved by them.
The captain is known forgetting things done.  This AI is terrible. AI is non-existential
"twitter, the movie"
"This looked interesting.. but, oh........ it's crap treck"
The world has that system just need to be destroy
"The Orville is one of the funniest series I've ever seen.
Seth Macfarlane is a GENIUS, and that's a FACT."
I didn't know democracy could be this bad 
this sounds more like KRLD than democratic world but ok lol (the first planet)
Corrected  UUUOOOOOOHHHHHHH
"They fly ships but have no knowledge of political science. Yes, prove your mortal and the people in power who have been killing others in her name will just suddenly step down.  Them coming back down just breaks the rules even further."
Me hearinh izuck izuckdeesnuts
Not true not at all
"Wow, talk about a glimpse into the future. I'm surprised we aren't mandated to wear vote badges already. That's right up there with credit and freedoms being determined by what we search for or post on the internet.  I'm already pretty familiar with some of the agents keeping close tabs on me, but guys, seriously, I'm an introvert. I can't handle all that attention at once."
Seth should just stick to Family Guy and American Dad.
"Why I'm having some ""The Giver"" vibes. Both societies are indeed dictatorial."
They turned reddit into a planet.
Dam
Nah we would all become stronger like goku did in 100x gravity and become super sayain
Redditors got a planet Jesus.
ohhoho
"Honestly, an upvote downvote social system doesn't seem that bad"
I completely fail to see the purpose of this video
Broo XD
Lamar or who ever must of been a part of this worlds little mermaid reboot. MAkes since for the 9million down votes.
I'm going to pass on this movie. Lol their friends got in trouble because they didn't give up their seat to a pregnant woman when clearly an open seat in front of them and my question is why is no one else on the bus in trouble just because they're sitting next to each other or because that she was standing next to them either way lazy director can't pick up on little details on stuff in my opinion the person that took a picture of them standing there not knowing about the pregnant woman but they noticed the pregnant woman they should be the ones in trouble just sitting there and taking a picture not doing anything about it just to rent somebody out goes to tell you no matter what in the future there's always a snake
They are pretty bad at being someone who have jumped planet to planet like their hobby.
So it's a shitty version of that Black Mirror episode?
8:27/8:28(lmrpsun)-8:29 (hs) nse (prt whr it jns 'ebrw wla ie ebrw chy lvl cha' dkya cha prt) - Res fr imp.
The English language dominates the Galaxy
I think society needs these badges! lmao imagine avoiding all Karens because you can see thier downvote.
China : the movie.
Someone used too many drugs to write this movie.
"I love how I saw one guy put it. Democracy is a system of the people, by the people, and for the people……..but the people are stupid."
"Apology video
Down vote upvote 
Yup sound like social media"
"ok 100% this isnt a real person talking right, it has to be AI because it fucks up a lot of the words and just continues to plow on, if its a real person kudos for just ignoring the mistakes lol if its an ai, damn AI do better lol"
"Oh yah.,movie was about ""gravity"" not voting for people to be corrected or Kelly the God.,"
1 month ago
Lamar is a freaking dummy . Lol why would he dance on a statue on an important mission in a planet that he doesn’t even know about ..
Lol you seem to have “medieval” and Neolithic mixed up. The 15th century was the tail end of the Middle Ages depending on who you ask.
…did they turn cancel culture into a movie?  Thanks for enduring this movie so I didn’t have to lol 
basically reddit
"On the power On El Shaddai Elohim Adoni Ahcad Shama Israel forever and ever Amen 
El Roi 
On the power On St Gabriel 
On the power On St Michael "
"Anyone else see it at 13:13???

Also I just want to say that this episode is a complete mock of Christianity with Kelly being a parody of Jesus who was supposedly the son of God but in reality just a high conscious human who was able to do extraordinary feats. Many enlightened masters of the past done double if not more of what Jesus could have done but he was worshipped in order to keep the masses subjugated and powerless"
""
Family guy lol
Haha omg
Lol
""
Reminds me of how realigion works or see what happens in a Christian or realigion community if you do not do or bealive on what they bealive in you are shun and bullied.
"If it was that simple for Christians.
Jesus is not god.
He healed people with the permission of God."
"I'm glad I haven't seen this movie. Its just a Star Trek copy, but with worse story."
 same ol inadequate false claims w/  UNIVERSE SIZE lies.    
the
on china if you have low social credit you gain less chance to get work free money discounts and travel priveldges
hey Lois I’m Captain Kirk Lois heh heh heh heh  heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
That's the shittiest summary of a TV show I've ever seen.
This is a great example of how political parties use the internet.  Propaganda is a very powerful tool.  How needs facts right?
Year 2064 talk is ban real or fake
"A public democracy social credits like system. But people are stupid, there willbe no one alive."
"Culture identitical to 21st century earth, just means ""low budget"" episode"
Kelly u akbar boom
I'm surprised that the voting system is actually used as intended and not abused. Lamar basically sealed his own fate with bad decisions one after the other instead of just keeping to himself. and not giving up the seat to a pregnant woman? seriously? might not be worth deleting all of your memories for but what the fuck man
"Space…the final frontier…

T H E S E  A R E  T H E  V O Y A G E S   O F  T H E  S T A R S H I P  “E N T E R P R I S E”"
Basically Likes and Dislikes on Youtube and Twitter :p
"Such nonsense. A futuristic society can create a cargo cult but after staying a while, not a brief encounter."
So Kelly is Jesus and that planet is Earth. Where's our robot savior?
L didn't need to be an a$$ in a strange place
Good thing about all the dumb mistakes is that this is a comedy show. Like why wouldnt they just fabricate some medieval clothes before they go to the planet.
Lamar kinda deserves the downvotes for that level of social cue cluelessness
Soooooo what's the point of watching the show if this YouTuber will just Spoil the Show Oo
" man, even the recap became so boring very fast. Stopped mid way"
mob rule.. twitter IRL
Planet reddit
Are you lot insane ? This is worse than the USS enterprise was in 1990 something
Really the translation of the movie is saying that us black folks can't take things serious that's why they had the only black guy dancing and then you learned that to downvotes is a shining of people who are outcasted in society that sounds oddly familiar you see that in a lot of movies of it saying basically the black guy can't take things seriously
the fatter saps get it would go way faster.
I feel pity for Lamar ..  he was stupid as hell
"Yes, what if tiktok was real life. Really terrible experince :-("
when reddit comes to real world
What if someone had 1 billion down votes.
If reddit was real
im i the only guy that thinks that this society looks like reddit
Why not just play the episode instead of using this BORING narration?  What's the point?
So the message here has gone from do not interfere with primitive species to break the federations main law interfere with the species and make them like you I’m surprised we didn’t become the Borg
Back when the show was good the last season was all lgtsht
Even a super qualified well trained black guy is still a black guy according to Hollywood. He will arrive at an alien planet and wild out instantly.
Canceling culture took a drastic turn here 
Of course it’s the Black guy that’s arrested. 
Why is this a Star Trek Ripoff?
anyone else think lamar and the 2 dudes who didnt give up their seats caused their own dumb situations and actually deserved to be ridiculed maybe not killed but seriously made themselves stick out like sore thumbs when they supposedly was on a covert mission and was supposed to be blending in?  i wonder who wrote his character as well cause bro was just ignorant as most characters like that are stereotype much arent they supposed to be advanced why they acted like immature entitled idiots
They should have just threatened global war with the planet
Lamar was an extra kinda of stupid on that planet
I have no sympathy for Laymar
This is blatant plagiarism - Start Trek.  Just beam them out. Geez.
Lamar fked himself up
The downvote system is insane stupid!
This is literally a star trek ripoff
O my Those pronunciations were awful 
I'm so mad you recapped this.. my brain did not need to see them sorry Nigerian vfx
Perfection has never existed. Even god made mistakes. It’s in the Bible.
this movie is a pure copy of dragon ball
Seriously… Who is this bot created content even made for? I’m so freaking sick of it appearing in my recommended
Kelly is the town's saviour. That means she is the daughter of Jesus! This is just a joke
That chick really ruined everything because she lacked the discipline to NOT contaminate the culture lmao yet she sits next to the captains chair?? 
I mean these people were acting stupid for drawing attention to them by dancing with statues and the other is being dick heads I understand that you're not always obligated to give up your seat to someone else but these guys are officers and typically military are trained to be more decent at least they should be I know people would give up their seats for them because of their service but it just seems so strange you pick these people based on their skill sets and personality and the personality is some of these people I'm just floored by
Redditors Paradise
"The series starts well,nice humour here and there, with a good storyline and dialogue. But as the series progresses, the humour fades and it just becomes another boring drama. Lost interest, never watched the third series."
I wish I could down vote Lamar.
Some people worship jesus because they think he's God but smart people they know he's not God but he's messenger of God.
"What i learnt from this Movie : 

Dmeocracy sucks, Religion sucks, A.I Robots FTW !!! "
If reddit was a society
Lol Christians history in a nutshell 12:43 13:25

Please make your videos shorter!
oh hellg nah reddit planet 
Lamar was just stupid tbh
Hilarious show
"im sorry, but that dude lamar deserved everything he got"
4:06 Lysella is so cute and hot 
Orwellian-style cancel culture in a nutshell 
Lamar annoyed me so much
You live in the future and are exposed to all different kinds planets and races but that is how you act when you go to one?  Is respect and diplomacy non-existent in the future?  I wouldn't act like that now even in my own country.
Bro this is if cancel culture evolves in the future
Kelly = Mohammad 
Bro. You murdered all of this. I want to unfollow you now.
Democratic….or mob ruled? Democratic means that the people get to choose who creates and regulates the law. The masses don’t usually make the direct final judgements.
They built their religion on something a lil kids said 
Society if reddit
Sus
Wait a second!!!! Lamar will be corrected?... why the happy fun BLACK guy has to be the one to get corrected? Hmmm
Black guy downvoted/dies first 
Upvote this if you want to downvote Lemars Behavior.
Yeah TS would get downvote more foh sho
"Meanwhile, Democrats: ""We're running out of gravity!! We need to start using less of it!"""
china
Religion is a scary thing
I vote  to Lamar
Meowmeowbeanz
If cancel culture had a planet sargas-4 would be it.
Only in Ohio
So cringy this guys commentary with the names of things in the show. Like Molloy being mistaken for Mallory like come on. Have u even seen the show or r u just reading q cards?
S. Not z
Can't decide if the second episode is imperialist propaganda or not.
"and is the flesh 10X?


regurgitated crap"
"What the fuck is this? Just go watch the show, people."
Reddit Planet
The future run by fruitcakes
Wow this was bad.  Just terrible.
"Sadly, the black character's actions are all too true to life."
Oh I see means Islam means Kelly now

This is a ripoff of star trek
Reddit the movie
Reddit

How did they make so many mistakes if they’re professionals like I am honestly baffled
"BBBBBLJAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DEBILIZAM!!!!!!!!!!!!"
When voting is based on feelings everyone loses take joe biden as an example of this
Star Trek rip off
Is this about Jesus lowkey ?
Fucking reddit? lol
reddit planet
They named a spaceship after a FNaF character?
Adrianne Palicki is painfully hot lol
"Kelly was no one but ALLAH , A man made story "
Lamah is irritating
I'm glad we don't live in a world of votes. I don't want to live in my past mistakes. Every day is a chance to be better than yesterday.
Isn't this similar to islam
Cancel culture lol
Yawn
Seems like a cheap Star Trek clone. Yawn.
jesus loves you
"""Completely democratic"" - illegal to not wear a stupid opinion badge"
Ohhh this fake ass Star Trek
Dude this one sucked
"This feels like the ultimate ""boomer complains about wokeism"" movie."
This a movie about cancel culture and mob culture lol nice
Of course they made a 90 pound woman the strongest 
another black dude in prison - murica
this show just sounds awful
How did they not invent memory eraser most racist people I've seen
killing of the black man firs t. average racism movie. i will leave a bad comment .
"On Zargas 4, Donald Trump doesn't become president because the reddit nation swarmed the delivery room and mass downvoted him the second he was born"
Look a movie about the dangers of the Communist social credit system. Pay attention.
"Makes you wonder if Jesus and God, or any god from any religion, are just like Kelly who accidentally changed the world trying to help someone and entire cultures misinterpreted it."
the muslims now thinks kelly is god
Jesus has died for our sins
Some woke Star Trek wannabe BS here
Yeah democrats
@15:15 of course the enlighten ones are black people.
"What's interesting is that in the book of revelations a person or being will raise itself above everything that is called God and deny that Jesus is Savior of the world.
It will do signs and wonders to deceive, many people will stop believing in Christ. Interesting similarities."
