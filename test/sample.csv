74,itsclarityco,youtube,"29:25 For those who drive, I would suggest that maybe you want to discount the fact that you drive when you consider the location of the house that you're buying. Because, what if farther down the down, you want to switch to public transport? Or our car policies change and it becomes ridiculously expensive to drive, or it no longer makes sense to drive? So don't put too much weight on the fact that you drive. I was lucky. When I bought my current place, my friend was telling me how convenient public transport here is, but we both also acknowledge that it didn't really matter since I drove. Now that I no longer see the sense in owning a car, I'm so grateful that I'm well-connected as far as public transport is concerned. Phew..."
