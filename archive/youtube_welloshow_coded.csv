3,"I'm looking forward for both Jufri & Sham to berdamai... whilst the world is coming to an end stop fighting guys...

& jujur dari tutur kata both of u in this interview both of u still have care & love of each other. U both may not know that ada yg sengaja nak laga¬≤ kan both of u...

like wat Juff said both of u have bizz to hustle with.. both of u somehow have gd in u & I'm sure as a public figure u both wanna continue reach out to pplp in an inspiring ways..

remove the toxic remove the ego maju sama¬≤ support & show love to the world & for each other... this is my take..

Fighting solves nothing...
& after boxing in the professional ring wats the aftermath n satisfaction seeing each other injured? in pain? bleed? 

wat if k.o? Nauzubillah... 
Thus far all professional Athletes will still feel sad or be in tears when they see their opponents lie flat unconscious..

Sabr, Sabr, Sabr... itulah panji perikemanusiaan... 


again both of u are good guys... 
jgn terjebak dgn desakkan bisikkan Syaitan..

I'm nobody nor am I perfect nor a fighter I'm nothing but I easily feel sad seeing our own pplp having beef, fighting, bickering on each other. it's all about 'words of choice' 

Akhir kata I wish both all well dan saya doa semoga u both come to terms & berdamai.. Insyaallah.. Aamin..",pos,n
