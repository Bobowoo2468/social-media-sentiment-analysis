30,Im kinda curious how jade’s child is doing and how he/she looks like hehe,pos,n
31,Now this is an awesome show..,pos,n
32,"Honestly Dew is such a champ for being patient and listening to his friends giving genuine advice to him even on set. I think a lot of people (including myself) would feel so disrespected/demeaning to hear other people telling you that you're wrong straight up like an intervention, moreover on a show recorded for everyone to see. Dew doesn't seem to lose his temper or get frustrated when everyone's pointing the finger at his faults, but calmly take it in and evaluate it for himself (at least what we see from the video). It's a trait that a lot of people can't do because they just don't like hearing that they are in the wrong. Kudos to everyone on this show who are willing to share authentic conversations that doesn't come off as fake or clout-chasing. Hope Jade can share more stories and be more vulnerable on set (I know she's a strong woman, but hopefully she can open up and share her feelings more if she's comfortable in the future).",neg,n
33,"Omygod, loving this! All the way guys... Also it is nice to hear the stories cos like twenties are so hard to navigate and its nice seeing that you are not aloneee",neu,n

0,"Cheating is a choice made, it is not inevitable. If you can’t even control yourself and have the discipline and morale to stay loyal and committed to your partner, then I feel like you shouldn’t get into any relationship, unless it’s mutually open. (Just my opinion).",neu,n
1,Cheating is honestly the worst thing you could ever do in a marriage. Whats the point in getting married if youll end up cheating ? Just dont get committed.,pos,n
2,How can u admit to cheating with a straight face lol,neu,n
3,If dew says all his past gf's were insecure.... then has he considered the fact that maybe he was the problem to begin with?,neu,n
4,"Of course attractive people would say cheating is not so bad or even okay. The world is their oyster and they can always find someone better out there. The rest of us who are less attractive don't have the opportunity if we wanted to, how to cheat? haha.",neg,n
5,Tbh they talking about how if you feel you don’t love someone anymore then just leave but like love can be a choice to go through the good and bad with someone so i really couldnt relate on this LEL sorry man,pos,n

11,basically dun commit until the trust is there if not its just toxic af,neu,n
12,Omo. The way dew touched his heart when talking about Amelia ♡,neu,n
13,"Damn tbh if you're really young, you should realise feelings  are complicated and that feelings for another person come and go. Those feelings can come when you're in a relationship or when you're single, so it makes things especially complicated. Give it a few weeks and those feelings for the new person might just leave completely anyway. Munah talk talk only, wouldn't go so far as emotional cheating ala ""I really love this new guy"". If the guy interesting then can make friend what",pos,n
14,they are literally JUST SAYING anything they want. love the chaotic energy,pos,n
15,"Wanna hear more about you guys’ views on polygamy AND polyamory; where to draw the line, what is and isn’t ok etc

28,this cast is perfection,neu,n
29,Just found this channel and I love y'all!,neu,n
30,"Cheating in a relationship is unhealthy.. If you do not want to be in a relationship with that person anymore, just break up so both parties can move on. Instead of trying to still be with that person and fulfill your own thirst for other guys/girls. That is so selfish. Marriage in the other hand is totally different from just a regular relationship, marriage is a commitment and a responsibility both have to bear. If you have desires to cheat and also cannot forego the lifestyle, don't bother to try marrying or getting married.",pos,n
31,The pillow matching safff,pos,n

10,"I think Kesha's fight was very fair - imo even if I might not be the biggest birthday person myself, it's fair to assume that other people would be, or at least care a little bit about their own birthdays.
